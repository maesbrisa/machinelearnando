LAGOS - NIGERIA.


YOUR KIND ATTN.,



RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâ€™s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).
Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.  

Yours Faithfully,
Capt JOHN OKELE

Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

Remember how you lusted after your friend's mum in high
school? She was 46 and you were 15? Remember the time
when she bent over to do her gardening and you saw her
sagging breasts through the v-neck opening of her summer
dress? She was OLD and you LOVED her! All you wanted to
do was FUK that Dirty Old Mole BLUE! You can now! Follow
the link below to see just how OLD & DIRTY these moles are!

Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
"Dot Com" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called "Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

** THE BULKBOOK
Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit
bulk emailer.  Secret techniques and tips never
before revealed.

you guessed it, bulk email!

If you added up all of the FULL VERSION BULK EMAIL software

$499.  I am giving you the whole bundle for only $29.99.

Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: "You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."
Believe me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say "Bull", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: "This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything."

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the "cash" is not because this is
illegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
"Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big."

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
"I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks."

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."

Lagos, Nigeria.
Dear Sir,

IMPORTANT.

After due deliberation with my colleagues, We have decided to forward to
you this business proposal. We want a reliable 
person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( 
$20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World
Countries.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This 
bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The
contract has since been executed, 
commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.
We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part 
of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for
our own use. But under our protocol division, we 
as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This
is why we are soliciting your assistance in this 
manner and regard .

As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address
from adverts in the business directory . I am the 
Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and
TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. 
Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this
Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this 
opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
we cannot afford to miss.

We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us and I and one of my colleagues 
involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,
upon the confirmation from you that the Certified 
International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.

Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your
interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel 
No: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and
City(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert 
Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax
you or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS 
TRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get
through.
NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please
inform us so that we can look for another reliable 
person who can assist in this respect. 

It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be 
discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual
trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this 
transaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and
security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured
and feel free to go into this transaction with 
us.
But let Honesty and Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and
your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
Thank you, and God bless.

Best Regards,

DR. SAMUEL  EBOKA.

REGISTER DOMAINS FOR JUST $14.95


The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/ today for more info.
 
Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Domain Administrator

 Welcome to Jefferson Pilot's
 Gateway to Wealth
 As one of the industry's premier producers, you must continually seek
qualified cutting edge services.
 Financial Profiles	
 Concept	Profiles+ Professional is a personal and business
analysis tool that analyzes a client's insurance, investment and
financial planning goals, to help them see their situation today
compared to their objectives. 	
 Market	Profiles+ Professional is an ideal tool for true financial
planning. It not only provides a thorough analysis, including asset
allocation, but it can calculate tax implications in a client's plan.
Due to its modular format, it can be used for specific planning needs,
as well as more comprehensive planning. 	
 Benefits
This software not only provides exceptional analysis, but excels in
providing simple as well as comprehensive presentation pages. By
uncovering multiple needs, producers sell more products.	 
 Deferral+	
 Concept	An internet-based "sales-enabling" service, which allows
users to quickly become successful in the deferred compensation (COLI)
market. 	
 Market	Focus on mid-market businesses. In the area of executive
benefits, the mid-market opportunity should be defined by either the
number of employees within a company, or more specifically by the number
of highly compensated executives within a company.	 
 Benefits
A turnkey program that includes qualification of prospect, marketing and
sales support, case design, plan documents and administration. 	
 G.I.F.T.	
 Concept	Global Insurance Funding Transaction (G.I.F.T.) is a
sophisticated premium-financing program that provides an alternative
funding mechanism for life products purchased to offset large estate and
corporate liabilities. 	
 Market	Clients with a high net worth of at least $10 million who have
an insurance need and believe their existing portfolio of investments,
when left unliquidated, will earn more then they will have to pay on
loan interest expenses. 	
 Benefits
G.I.F.T. offers compelling sales solutions, comprehensive supplemental
illustrations and access to a consortium of established banks willing
and able to lend in this market. Loans are available in both U.S.
dollars and Japanese Yen.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish with you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY
SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).

This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Cte d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Cte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. The security
of this business is very important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.
Thank you and God bless you.

VICTOR SANKOH

THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
Believe it, work it. 
This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
try!! 
You will be glad you did. 
Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
IN HIS CLOSET! 
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
You most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", 
says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
and I started sending it out", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He 
goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
carry it all". 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)." 
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, "Please send me report number 
XYX".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee. 
[This is the end of the media release. If you would 
like to understand how the system works and get your 
$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 
instructions]. 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
================================================== 
You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
home!! 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
=========================================================
=======Here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first:

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily 
and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and 
AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$ 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME 
TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
=========================================================
======= 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
=========================================================
======= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
=========================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT 
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
=========================================================
======= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the report. 
===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 
========================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always 
send 
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 
one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 
are ordering, 
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. 
PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue 
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN 
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will 
continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your 
name 
is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME 
SEND 
ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS 
AGAIN. There is NO 
LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!!

====================== MORE 
TESTIMONIALS====================== 
'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
on me! 
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
joined 
Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
=========================================================
======= '' Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised 
when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 
that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 
investment 
with a faster return and so big''. 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=========================================================
======= '' I had 
received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who 
to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 
again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my 
first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=========================================================
====== 
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

This is the bottom line.  If you can GIVE AWAY CD's for FREE to people (like 80-100 in one month) and then let ME talk to them FOR you - if you can GIVE AWAY free product samples -  then YOU can earn $5,000 in the next 30 - 45 days.

Think I'm kidding?  We earned PRECISELY $26,087.58 in our first 94 days doing JUST that - and we scanned our checks online for you to see them with your own eyes!  We've TWEAKED things a little because WE DON'T WANT you to talk to ANYONE.  WE WANT to talk to people FOR YOU.

if you are ....
VERY BUSY or,
Aren't GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE or,
DON'T WANT to talk to people....

Then let US work FULL TIME for you.  We've helped others....
   Julie P. earned $750 in one week with us
   Jeff A. earned $6500 in 5 weeks with us

And we NOW have an EXACT business plan for you and can tell you EXACTLY what to expect with where you're starting.  No guesswork - we've done it.

And if you DO want to seriously evaluate this, we would be HAPPY to even fly you to Los Angeles at OUR expense to get a closer look!  NO KIDDING!

IMPORTANT DOMAIN INFORMATION:


The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/ today for more info.
 
Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Domain Administrator

INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. 

Research Alert - Undervalued
August 26, 2002
XrayMedia
(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8

Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 

Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.

Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 

Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!

How does the company do this? 

XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a "mass source to advertising sector " live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 

Their "source to business model", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.

While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.

 *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.

*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 

*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.

*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.

*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 

*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings "substantially" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.
 
Shares Outstanding:      	83 mm

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.

Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: "You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."
Believe me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say "Bull", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: "This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything."

More testimonials later but first, =======

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the "cash" is not because this is
illegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
"Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big."

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
"I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks."

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."

MR MARTIN FRANCIS
ABIDJAN COTE DIVOIRE
WEST AFRICA
TEL:+225 05775748.
                  
                  
                  URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSAL

ATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,

I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and Gods person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.

I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote divoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of Cte dIvoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
Cte dIvoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,provided

you cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment

<P>For example if you go into a shop and buy Windows XP Pro, for about $299 you 
get the Serial, the CD, the Box and the Manual.<BR><BR>If you order it off us, 
you get:<BR>The Windows XP CD and the Serial Number. It works exactly the same, 
but you don't get the manual and box and the price is only $19.99.<BR>That is a 
saving of $280, and the only difference is you don't have a colorful box and 
manual - which are not very 
useful.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran
ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: 

Thanks and regards. 

MR.IKE EJOH

How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, "Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, "Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?"

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No "hocus pocus" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

Dear sir,,


My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo
Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South
African Information exchange Johannesburg.
.

Due to the previous war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters
to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
presidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded my
fathers farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
him and confiscated all his investment.

Early last year when this victimization of white
farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father
envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.
When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a
private security company through the help of his
lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real
contents of the box to the security company, then,
went back home. He registered the box as family
treasure.

While he was still in detention that led to his death
due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South
Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He
was arrested on the 5th of March last year.
Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.

Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and
depressing because my fathers lawyer is presently
hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;
though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I
want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,
my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum
permit as a refugee.

I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of
this country to your country for investment. If you
think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with
me immediately with the  number below . Your
compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my
country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
this information to yourself and secret, because I
wouldnt want anything that will expose me, and the
existence of this money.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

STEVEN DUBA (DR).

                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          *** 801-296-4140 *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                             *** 801-296-4140 ***

Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: "You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."
Believe me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say "Bull", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: "This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything."

More testimonials later but first, =======

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the "cash" is not because this is
illegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
"Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big."

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
"I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks."

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."

CDs, also known as Warez CDs. Backup CDs are copies of Software. 
<P>For example if you go into a shop and buy Windows XP Pro, for about $299 you 
get the Serial, the CD, the Box and the Manual.<BR><BR>If you order it off us, 
you get:<BR>The Windows XP CD and the Serial Number. It works exactly the same, 
but you don't get the manual and box and the price is only $19.99.<BR>That is a 
saving of $280, and the only difference is you don't have a colorful box and 
manual - which are not very 
useful.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

Even our own two signature "smokables" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This "Shangrila" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves "potent significance" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after "flowering" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all "viripotent," which makes this "gnarly stoke" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve "viripotency" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, "sensitive/responsive", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking ("Smoka") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced "ambiance."
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* "Potentiated" & viripotent!
* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No "munchie" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly "SweetGrass" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent "Smoka", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of "Smoka" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent "Sensitive / Responsive" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) "Sensitive/Responsive" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time....

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.)

It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,
"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
"NEVER".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

GE Lifetime ProtectorSM is subject to the terms, issue limitations and
conditions of Policy Form Nos. UL GE02 et al for GE Capital Assurance
and ULFCL02 et al for First Colony Life, which include exclusion periods
for death by suicide. GE Lifetime ProtectorSM is not available in all
states. 

1Premium that guarantees coverage for the life of the insured according
to the companies' provisions.
Companies refer to premium by different names and the conditions for the
guarantee will vary from company to company. For GE Lifetime
ProtectorSM, this refers to the designated premium requirement: subject
to the policy provisions, policy remains in force as long as the sum of
the premiums paid, less the reduction in policy value for all partial
withdrawals, equals or exceeds the cumulative total of the designated
monthly premiums from the policy date to the end of the current policy
month.

2Premiums calculated assuming each company's current crediting rate and
charges. Each column represents the premium required annually to age 100
to achieve target cash surrender value stated in the column heading.

DEAR FRIEND,I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.
I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS
GEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER
FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW
HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M. SESE SEKO

        This eBay and Internet e-course, live web training

        <br>
        <br>
        This special <strong>FREE</strong> offer has been brought
        to you by your friends at eBay Auction News. Craig Meyer
        (The Auction Man) has agreed to provide you a <strong>free
        &quot;live&quot; training class</strong> that you won't
        want to miss.<br>
        <br>
        You might say &quot;Craig Meyer - the Auction Man?&quot;
        That's because most of you remember Craig as the real estate
        guru who in 1997 helped over 2,000 families buy their own
        homes using little or none of their own money. Craig was
        featured on television programs throughout the country
        for this incredible effort. Craig is not one of those get
        rich quick gurus - but a guy who has helped families
        realize the American Dream - I will tell you Craig Meyer
        is the real deal! <br>
        <br>

FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. We were then given this money privately 
by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late President Kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Thank you and God Bless. 
Best Regards 


COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com

N\B. When you are calling my line, you dial your country Intl. access
code, then you dial directly, do not include my country 
code i.e. (243). Just dial your country Intl. access code + 88216

email addresses.

                  Welcome to "Ghetto" America!
...Yes, you heard me; I said "Ghetto" America! What is "Ghetto" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! "Ghetto" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of "Black America;" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the "projects" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
"teen looking" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important "wedding band" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
"Thugs" or "Street Hustlers;" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the "projects" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    "Attention" This is Not another "Boyz in the Hood" Story!
 
These newly distinguished "Black Generation Xers" are suffering 
through utter chaos. "Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in "Black America," and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
"Mainstream American Society." A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young "Black America" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.

I need those houses...

Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use "unconventional" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 

I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 

If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com 

Best Wishes, 
Jeremy Lessaris

Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************

Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.

Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.

Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.

Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.

Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.

Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.

Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.

This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.

Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to "stiff" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************

=======REST OF MESSAGE======================

With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!

READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: "You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?"  No matter where
you believe those "feelings" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.

= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =

If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.

===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================

Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.

Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.

Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.

Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.

If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)

If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795

If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.

There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.

METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.

The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than "customer
service" in the retail or the  "bricks and mortars" business.

===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  "wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.

PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.

=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!
===========================================
A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't
wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You
can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.

Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you
have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved
others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the
people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
emails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember, the more you send out the more potential
buyers you will reach.

IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND
EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!

Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the
Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights:
(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the

to resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1
is a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It's
free of charge and will give you the tools you need.

The right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES
is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to
resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 

Best regards, 
Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

* Minimum Premium to Endow is a hypothetical, non-guaranteed premium
that, based on current charges and the current interest rate, would keep
the policy in force to age 100. Interest rates and charges will change
over time, as will the Minimum Premium to Endow. These premiums are
shown as hypothetical figures based on the stated assumptions and are
shown for comparative purposes only. The actual premium needed to keep
the policy in force is based on actual results and may be higher or
lower. ** All guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the
issuer.

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Dear 
Friend,<BR><BR>A recent survey by Nielsen/Netratings says that "The Internet 
<BR>population is rapidly approaching a 'Half a Billion' people!"<BR><BR>SO WHAT 
DOES ALL THIS MEAN TO YOU? EASY MONEY!!<BR><BR>Let's assume that every person 
has only one E-mail address...<BR>that's 500 million potential customers and 
growing! In addition,<BR>E'mail is without question the most powerful 
method of distributing<BR>information on the face of the earth.<BR><BR>Well, I 
think you get the picture. The numbers and potential are <BR>just 
staggering, but it gets even better...<BR><BR>Suppose I told you that you could 
start your own E-mail business<BR>today and enjoy these 
benefits:<BR><BR> *** All Customers Pay You In 
Cash!!!<BR> *** You Will Sell A Product Which Costs 
Nothing to Produce!<BR> *** Your Only Overhead Is Your 
Time!<BR> *** You Have 100s Of Millions Of Potential 
Customers!!!<BR> *** You Get Detailed, Easy To Follow 
Startup 
Instructions!<BR><BR> AND 
THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG . . .<BR>As you read on you'll discover how 
a 'Seen on National TV' <BR>program is paying out a half million dollars, every 
4 to 5 months<BR>from your home, for an investment of only $25 US Dollars 
expense,<BR>one time. ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE . . . <BR>AND THE 
INTERNET!<BR><BR>Before you say "Bull", please read the following:<BR>This is 
the letter you have been hearing about on the news<BR>lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet,<BR>a national weekly news program 
recently devoted an entire<BR>show to the investigation of this program 
described below,<BR>to see if it really can make people money.<BR><BR>The show 
also investigated whether or not the program was<BR>legal. Their findings 
proved once and for all that there are<BR>"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the 
participation in the<BR>program and if people can follow the simple 
instructions,<BR>they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out 
of<BR>pocket cost".<BR><BR> DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE 
OF POPULARITY<BR> AND RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED,<BR> IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN 
EVER!<BR><BR>***** This is what one had to say:<BR><BR>"Thanks to this 
profitable opportunity. I was approached many<BR>times before but each 
time I passed on it. I am so glad I<BR>finally joined just to see what one 
could expect in return<BR>for the minimal effort and money required. To my 
asonishment,<BR>I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money 
still<BR>coming 
in".<BR><BR> Pam 
Hedland, Fort Lee, New 
Jersey<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Here 
is another testimonial:<BR><BR>"This program has been around for a long time but 
I never<BR>believed in it. But one day when I received this again in 
<BR>the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the<BR>simple 
instructions and walaa. . . . 3 weeks later the money<BR>started to come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the<BR>next 2 months after that I 
made a total of $290,000.00.<BR>So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I <BR>have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again.<BR><BR>The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple<BR>steps and NOT change 
anything."<BR><BR>More testimonials later but first:<BR><BR>** PRINT THIS NOW 
FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE<BR><BR>If you would like to make at least $500,000 
every 4 to 5 <BR>months easily and comfortably, please read the following . . 
.<BR>THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!<BR><BR>**FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE 
INSTRUCTIONS,<BR> TO MAKE YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS 
<BR> COME 
TRUE**<BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS:<BR>-------------------<BR>***** Order all 5 reports 
shown on the list below.<BR><BR>***** For each report, send $5 US CASH, THE NAME 
& <BR>NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and<BR>YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to 
the person whose name appears<BR>ON THAT LIST next to the 
report.<BR><BR> MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR<BR> ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any 
mail<BR> problems.<BR><BR> 
*****When you place your order, make 
sure<BR> 
you order each of the 5 reports *****<BR><BR>You will need all 5 reports so that 
you can save them on your<BR>computer and resell them.<BR><BR>YOUR TOTAL COST $5 
X 5 = $25.00<BR><BR>**********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, 
each<BR>of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save<BR>them 
on your computer so they will be accessible for you to<BR>send to the 1,000's of 
people who will order them from you.<BR>Also make a floppy of these reports and 
keep it at your desk<BR>in case something happens to your 
computer.<BR><BR>**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the 
people<BR>who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the <BR>list, 
in any way other than what is intructed below in steps<BR>1 through 6 or you 
will lose out on the majority of your profits.<BR>Once you understand the way 
this works, you will also see how<BR>it does not work if you change 
it.<BR><BR>Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,<BR>it will 
NOT work!!!<BR><BR>People have tried to put their friends/relatives names 
on<BR>all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does<BR>not 
work this way. Believe us, we have tried to be greedy<BR>and then nothing 
happened.<BR><BR>So do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed.<BR>Because if you do, it will not work for you. 
Remember,<BR>honesty reaps the reward!!!<BR><BR>1. After you have ordered all 5 
reports, take this <BR>advertisement and REMOVE the name and address of the 
person in<BR>REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is 
<BR>no doubt counting their fortune.<BR><BR>2. Move the name & address in 
REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.<BR>3. Move the name & address in REPORT #3 down 
to REPORT #4.<BR>4. Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down to REPORT 
#3.<BR>5. Move the name & address in REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.<BR>6. 
Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT #1 Position.<BR><BR>PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & 
address<BR>ACCURATELY!<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Take 
this entire letter, with the modified list of names,<BR>and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER<BR>CHANGES. Save this on a disk as 
well just in case you loose<BR>any data.<BR><BR>To assist you with marketing 
your business on the Internet,<BR>the 5 reports you purchase will provide you 
with invaluable<BR>marketing information that includes: How to send bulk 
e-mails<BR>legally, Where to find thousand of free classified ads and <BR>much, 
much more.<BR><BR>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture 
going:<BR><BR> METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY<BR> 
---------------------------------------------------------<BR>Let's say that you 
decide to start small, just to see how<BR>it goes, and we'll assume you and 
those involved send out<BR>only 5,000 emails each. Let's also assume that 
the mailing<BR>receives only a 0.2% response (the response could be 
much<BR>better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many 
people<BR>will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of<BR>only 
5,000 each).<BR><BR>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 
e-mails.<BR>With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for Report #1.<BR>Those 
10 people resonded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each<BR>for a total of 
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%<BR>responded with 
orders. That's 100 people responded and<BR>ordered Report #2. Those 
100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails<BR>each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to <BR>that is 1000 orders for Report #3.<BR><BR>Thoe 1000 
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of<BR>5 million e-mails sent 
out. The 0.2% response to that is<BR>10,000 orders for Report #4. 
Those 10,000 people send out<BR>5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 
million)<BR>e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for<BR>Report #5.<BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = 500,000<BR>(a 
half a million).<BR><BR> Your total income in this 
example is:<BR> 1......$50 +<BR> 
2......$500 +<BR> 3......$5,000 
+<BR> 4......$50,000 +<BR> 
5......$500,000 .................. Grand Total = 
$555,550.00<BR><BR> NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND<BR> FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE 
RESPONSES AND <BR> NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU 
WILL<BR> STILL MAKE A LOT OF 
MONEY!<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR> 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10<BR> PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.<BR><BR>Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone,<BR>or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails<BR>each or more? There are over 250 million people on the 
<BR>Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people<BR>will do 
just that, and more!<BR><BR> METHOD #2: PLACING 
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR> 
<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Advertising 
on the net is very, very inexpensive and there<BR>are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise. Placing a lot of<BR>free ads on the internet will easily get a 
larger response.<BR>We strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add 
METHOD<BR># 2 as you go along.<BR><BR>For every $5 you receive, all you must do 
is e-mail them the <BR>Report they ordered. That's it! Always 
provide same day<BR>service on all orders. This will guarantee that the 
e-mails<BR>they send out, with your name and address on it, will be<BR>prompt 
because they can not advertise until they receive 
the<BR>report.<BR><BR> ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT NUMBER 
& NAME ONLY.<BR><BR>Note: Always send $5 cash (US Currency) for each 
report.<BR>Checks are NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is wrapped in<BR>at 
lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.<BR>On one of those 
sheets of paper, write the NUMBER and the NAME<BR>of the Report you are 
ordering, your email ADDRESS, your NAME<BR>and postal address. Make sure 
you affix the proper 'International'<BR>Postage if ordering a report from 
outside your country.<BR><BR> PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

TESTIMONIALS**********<BR><BR>"My name is Mitchell. My wife Jody and I 
live in Chicago.<BR>I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I 
make<BR>pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled<BR>to 
Jody about receiving "junk mail". I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, 
spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved. I 
"knew" it wouldn't work. Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence 
and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun 
of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when<BR>the thing 
didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within<BR>3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses. Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total 
of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 
"hobby".<BR><BR> Mitchell Wof, Chicago, 
Illinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to 
participate in this plan. But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back. I was 
surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with 
orders. I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing 
about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live. 
There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so 
big".<BR><BR> Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, 
Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"I 
had received this program before. I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if 
I should hav given it a try. Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else 
. . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again. I did not 
<BR>delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all 
the money came within 22 weeks".<BR><BR> Susan De 
Suza, New York, 
NY<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"It 
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money with little cost 
to you. I followed the simple<BR>instructions carefully and within 10 days 
the money started<BR>to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by 
the<BR>end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.<BR>Life is 
beautiful, thanks to the Internet".<BR><BR> Fred

Dear ilug@linux.ie 

Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. 
Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.

Why do people sell their policies? 
The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:

Pay off debts 
Fund long term care insurance cost 
Eliminate costly premiums 
Take advantage of other financial opportunities 
Make charitable contributions 
Help family members 
 
  
Life Partners Living Solutions 
  
Traditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners, it can provide cash benefits for LIFE! 
  
Life Partners Objectives 
Provide market appraisal for life insurance policy owners 
Provide bids for qualified policies 
Provide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners 
Eliminate costly premium payments  

Contact us now for a FREE appraisal of your life insurance policy.  REMEMBER THIS IS A FREE SERVICE AND THERE IS NO COST TO YOU !!

AFFORDABLE DOMAIN REGISTRATION FOR EVERYONE


The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/ today for more info.
 
Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Domain Administrator

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

LAGOS - NIGERIA.

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents
does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security
advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 

With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under
the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last
military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to
the confines of his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal
that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a
security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's
portfolio during his tenure
as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that
he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit
with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could
take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for
himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that
can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for
the execution of this endeavour are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred
Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we
can go 
through the rudiments of this endeavour.

I remain most obliged.

ATTN:

I am Bulawa Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, 
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

NOTE: DO REPLY TO bulmulete@golfemail.com


God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

Mr. BULAWA  MULETE JR

Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special "skills" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that "burning desire" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 information

"Send me a free membership!"

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with
"Remove" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for
both their consumer and business opportunities.

 If you need capital for your business or want to know how much it's
worth,
 Call Us Today!

Tap the hidden value of your business 
and get the cash you need today.

You've got money coming to you. But because it's in the form of renewal
commissions, it comes slowly. A little every year.

We're TWG Capital. We help turn your renewal commissions into immediate
cash - cash you can use any way you see fit. We are currently purchasing
renewal commissions from the following product lines: Long Term Care,
Medicare Supplement, Specified Disease, Life, and Health insurance.

                         Foreword

After thirty?three years of being a black man living in "Ghetto America," an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the "Black Generation X". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of "Generation X". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed "Baby Boomers", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled "Generation X", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: 
 
 "We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called "Xer's" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse."
"We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong." 

This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these "similarities" speak primarily to only "white" issues and concerns. For instance, "they" say "we" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America "we" could only depend on one our mothers! "They" also say, " . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations," and " . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever." In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all "we" have time for. 
I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the "Black" from "Generation X" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.
There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. "White America" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled "Ethnic Notions." When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching "Roger & Me," another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex
 posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.
Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.
 Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. 
What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with "Huxtable?like" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or "working class" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the "Huxtable?like" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. 
The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our "dirty laundry". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. 
I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. 
The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that "black male and female generation X" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)
Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.
In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. 
Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our "male rapper" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. "The Big Tymers", a popular rap duo, have a song called "I'm Still Fly", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. ("Fly" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:

"I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci
Suit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's
spent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly."

Worse yet, in the song "Grinding", the popular duo "Eclipse" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term "grinding" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are "grindingyou know what I keep in the lining" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and

"Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up
and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup"

In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term "cake" or sometimes "pie") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. 
The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al
 luded too. 
I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of "us" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. 
Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being "African?Americans", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as "Black", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as "Niggas," a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with "Nigger". The term "nigga" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term "My Nigga") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as "Ghetto", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the
  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. 
My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.
In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by "White America". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno
 wledging that this absence is by design. 
There are other "core" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not "thugged out". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the "thug," and "drug dealer" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. 
These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that "confused mentality" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American "ghetto" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that "ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into "Black America".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that "backward thinking" is the main 
 cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.

Dear Partner to be,

First, I must apologise to you for using this medium to communicate to you
about this project.

I am a highly placed official of  Government of Nigeria and also a
founding member of the ruling party in Power now,the Peoples Democratic
Party(PDP).

My committee - The Niger Delta Development Corporation(NDDC)-which is in
charge of managing and supervising  the disbursement of oil sales revenues
for the Nigerian government.The revenues  under our control runs into
several hundred of millions of dollars monthly.My self and   
other colleagues in the NDDC are currently in need of a foreign partner
with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of Forty Nine Million
Five Hundred Thosand United States Dollars($49.5m).This fund accrued to us
as commission for oil sales contracts handled under our supervision.

The fund is presently waiting in the Government Account named CBN/FGN
INDEPENDENT REVENUE account number 400-939134 with J.P.MORGAN CHASE
BANK,New York.You can do your independent verifictaion of this. However,
by virtue of our  position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we
cannot acquire this funds in our name. This is because as top civil

Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time!
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!!

The property market is moving very fast in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present you with a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

 Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers! 

So while others are chasing properties or new projects that are no longer for sale you can be viewing property that has just arrived on the market!

<P class=arial style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">It would be much more useful to the industry, if SPFA would help find a "CODE CONFORMING" fire barrier for attics, crawl spaces etc., than&nbsp; lecture on Fast and Loose applications of code.&nbsp; Something about 30 cents (a BD. FT.) installed, meeting All codes and spray applied. Many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect BUT they haven't spent the money to test over foam. Maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products, report results to SPFA, who in turn will "acquire funding" from US.</P>

<P class=arial style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I'm sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a "thermal Barrier". What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier, then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke in a fire situation? Sure, so what?</P>
<P class=arial style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><BR>Blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car. Get real, inspectors. You want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that DOESN'T BURN!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=arial style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">As for the vaunted R rating system, IT IS TOTALLY BOGUS. The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do.&nbsp; Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer, the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago, along with that obsolete fiberglass<BR>garbage they're still selling everybody.&nbsp; There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers coolers &amp; coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it.</P>

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

<div class=Section1>


<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free. Good luck!</p>

Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
"Dot Com" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called "Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

** THE BULKBOOK

Our research has found that many online entrepreneurs have
tried one or more of the following...

    Free Classifieds? (Don't work anymore)
    Web Site? (Takes thousands of surfers)
    Banners? (Expensive and losing their punch)
    E-Zine? (Hope they have a -huge- subscriber list)
    Search Engines? (Forget it, unless you're in the top 10)
   
         S O   W H A T   D O E S   W O R K ?

Although often misunderstood, there is one method that has
proven to succeed time-after-time.

<div class=Section1>


<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free. Good luck!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><a

Dear User,

Do you ever wish you could easily call people you know in other countries
for up to 85% less than standard call prices?! And then to make these savings
without having to subscribe to any low cost calling service?! We have now
launched a product that does exactly that!

You can now call people in most popular destinations around the world for
only 33 cents per minute! There are no hidden charges, you do not need to
signup, use any credit cards, or pay any extra bills! You can try this
service at no risk and choose to use it with no commitment!

To use this new service, simply dial our access number 1530 927 055 and
once connected, dial the actual international number you wish to call.

For more information and the current list of countries you can call, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/

Example: If you wanted to call a German number 0567 123 124 you would:

1) Dial 1 530 927 055
2) Wait until you connect to our system and hear a message asking you
   to dial the number you wish to call.
3) Dial the full international number starting 00. In this instance 00
   (for international) 49 (country code for Germany) 567 123 124 (their
   number without the initial zero)

You will only pay 33 cents per minute to access our system with no further
charges for any calls you make! You can also use this service to make
cheap international calls from mobiles too! However please check the
costs of calling 1530 numbers from your mobile if you are unsure.

You only ever pay for the cost of calling our access number which will
appear on your normal bill. However any international calls you make will
not appear on your bill, so you only ever pay 33 cents per minute when
using our service!

If calling from a mobile, please ensure that you do not press the green/send
key again after dialling the actual mobile number, or you will be billed
for a second call by your mobile operator.

If you have any questions or wish to contact us for more information, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/ for details.

If you are not interested in reducing your phone bills and would not like to
be informed of any other similar offers from ourselves, please reply to this
message with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject heading. If you have your
email forwarded, please ensure that you unsubscribe from the actual account
email is sent to. We apologise if this message has inconvenienced you in any
way.

<div class=Section1>


<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free. Good luck!</p>

================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to "look before you leap" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!


Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

Dear Partner to be,

First, I must apologise to you for using this medium to communicate to you
about this project.

I am a highly placed official of  Government of Nigeria and also a
founding member of the ruling party in Power now,the Peoples Democratic
Party(PDP).

My committee - The Niger Delta Development Corporation(NDDC)-which is in
charge of managing and supervising  the disbursement of oil sales revenues
for the Nigerian government.The revenues  under our control runs into
several hundred of millions of dollars monthly.My self and   
other colleagues in the NDDC are currently in need of a foreign partner
with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of Forty Nine Million
Five Hundred Thosand United States Dollars($49.5m).This fund accrued to us
as commission for oil sales contracts handled under our supervision.

The fund is presently waiting in the Government Account named CBN/FGN
INDEPENDENT REVENUE account number 400-939134 with J.P.MORGAN CHASE
BANK,New York.You can do your independent verification of this. However,
by virtue of our  position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we
cannot acquire this funds in our name. This is because as top civil
servants, we are not allowed by law of the land to own or operate bank
accounts outside our country for now.

I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues,
to look for an overseas partner in whose account we would
transfer the fund

Hence the reason for this mail.We shall be Transferring the money to your
account with your company as we shall present your company as a registered
Foreign company in Nigeria and you are been paid for a contract which you
executed for our country through the NDDC and any other Federal Ministry
that we decide to use to siphon the funds through.

For your support and partnership,please reply me to negotiate your fees or
the percentage you wish to be paid when the funds arrive your bank account.

You must however note that this transaction, with
regards to our disposition to continue with you, is subject
to these terms. Firstly, our conviction of your transparency.

NIGERIA ELECTIRC POWER AUTHORITY 
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT 
IKOYI-LAGOS.

FROM THE DESK OF:George Osawa
I am the Chairman Contract Review Committee of National 

Electric Power Authority (NEPA). 
Although this 
proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is 

coming from someone you do not know 
or ever seen
before, but after due deliberations with my colleagues, I 

decided to contact you based on 
Intuition. 

We are soliciting for your humble and confidential 

assistance to take custody of Seventy-
One Million,
Five Hundred Thousand United States 

Dollars.{US$71,500,000.00}. This sum 
(US$71.5M) is an over 
invoice contract sum which is currently in an offshore 

payment account of the Central Bank 
of Nigeria as an 
unclaimed contract entitlement which can easily be 

withdrawn or drafted or pay to any 
recommended 
beneficiary by my committee.

On this note, you will be presented as a contractor to 

NEPA who has executed a contract 
to a tune of the
above sum and has not been paid. 
Proposed Sharing Partern (%): 

1. 70% for me and my colleagues. 

2. 20% for you as a partner/fronting for us.

3. 10% for expenses that may be incurred by both parties 

during the cause of this 
transacton.

Our law prohibits a civil servant from operating a 

foreign account, hence we are contacting 
you. If this
proposal satisfies you, do respon as soon as possible 

with the following information: 

1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the 

fund. 

2. Your Confidential Phone and Fax Numbers. 

Further discussion will be centered on how the fund shall 

be transfer and full details on how 
to accomplish this 
great opportunity of ours.

Thank you and God bless. 

Best regards, 
George Osawa

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT:

The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.affordable-domains.com today for more info.
 
Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.affordable-domains.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Domain Administrator

Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. 

This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 

Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 

Best regards, 
Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

KEVIN GEORGE

ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE
WEST AFRICA

Dearest one,

Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.

Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
of kin to my father.

But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
I remain yours sincerely,

KEVIN GEORGE

I am MR.Johnson S. Abu, the bills and exchange Director at the
ForeignRemittance Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria.  I am 
writingyou
this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carrying thisbusiness

of
Nigeria who died along with his entire family of a wifeand two children in
Kenya Airbus (A310-300) flight KQ430 in November2000.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin tocome
over
and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannotrelease the fund
from his account unless someone applies for claims asthe next  of kin to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither
their
family member nor distant relative hasappeared to claim the said fund.  Upon
this discovery, I and other officialsin my department have agreed to make
business with you release the totalamount into your account as the heir of
the
fund since no one came forit or discovered either maintained account with
our
bank, other wisethe fund will be returned to the bank treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for
you as
foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I
willcome to
your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import
computer
accessories into my country as way of recycling thefund.  To commence this
transaction we require you to immediately indicateyour interest by calling
me
or sending me a fax immediately on the aboveTelefax # and enclose your
private
contact Telephone #, Fax #, full nameand address and your designated
banking co-
 ordinates to enable us fileletter of  claim to the appropriate department
for
necessary approvalsbefore the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept strictly confidential becauseof its
nature.

NB: Please remember to give me your Phone and Fax No

Program is 18 weeks old and it's paying.

Everybody gets in line to get paid by all
the new people coming in (but it's NOT a
traditional straightline)...EVERYONE makes money...

Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
Remain Blessed, 
MRS. ANNE  KOJO

Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special "skills" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that "burning desire" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 informtion

"Send me a free membership!"

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with
"Remove" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for
both their consumer and business opportunities.

DEAR FRIEND,I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.
I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS
GEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER
FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW
HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M. SESE SEKO

OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

you've always dreamed of owning. And then, go out and apply for a grant
to buy a home for you and your family. And once your new business starts
doing well you could go out and get another grant for expansion of your
business. The possibilities are endless.</font></font></blockquote>

Dear Sir,

I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of Nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account. 

There were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 
United
State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 


Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms. 
Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To 

accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
Once more I want you to understand that having put
in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. 

Please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable 
transaction. 
I want to assure you that this business proposal is
100% risk free as we have done our homework
properly. 

I quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
still in government service, which we intend to
retire from in full honor.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year. 

Thank you and God bless.

Dr James Alabi

It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,
"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
"NEVER".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

A great sponsor will not make you money.
A great product line will not make you money either.
A great compensation plan will not make you money either.
A great company will not make you money either.

Some say it's a combination of the above.
Some say it's what's inside you that matters the most.

Forget about meetings, one-on-one, 3-ways calls, etc.
Those old ways of network marketing has come and gone.
They wear you out long before you make any money.

What makes you money is a downline associated with a
stable company that has consumable products.

Where's the downline coming from?  Well, we have an
online automatic recruiting system that does the work
for you.  Our system will place paying members in 
your downline.

Furthermore, you can see it working first hand before
you decide what to do, if any.

Everybody gets paid.  No recruiting required.

Join and reserve a position for free now.
Program is 18 weeks old and it's paying.

Everybody gets in line to get paid by all
the new people coming in (but it's NOT a
traditional straightline)...EVERYONE makes money...
and those that sponsor make more....

It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,
"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
"NEVER".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com

<div class=Section1>


<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>CONSANTLY</b> being
bombarded by so-called FREE money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when its all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way,<b> after-the-fact</b>!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (<i>I have been self-employed all my life</i>), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (<i>great! because
I had none</i>) interested me to click on the link provided. And I dont regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (<i>when</i>) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><b>This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that Ive seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you no idea of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: <u>Whats it all about</u>? and <u>How
does it work</u>?. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you dont
want to do that; by then you are hooked and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! </b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I call this my Platinum
Choice because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, hook-first programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! Youve seen the headlines: <u>Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life</u> yeah, right!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldnt be able to do anything
without corporate help  which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internets explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time members support and even protective safeguards! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free. Good luck!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'><a

ATTN:

I am Edward Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

Please do not use the reply button, reply only to 

Edmulete7@netscape.net Please take note.

God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

Mr. EDWARD MULETE

OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time! 
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!! 

The property market is moving very fast here in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN
HIS CLOSET!

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old
sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.

"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old
woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of 
"Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.

"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever
15-year-old.

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list.

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.

"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I
was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".  Over
the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail."  The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds.

"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next
bank down the street (laughs)."  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid.The reporting news 

team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was
completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in
the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
"Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.

[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What 
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you
say "Bull", please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the
 Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".


DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER
THAN EVER.


Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.

In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money
for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.

This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was 
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I
only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I
have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything." More testimonials later but first,

PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE

++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT
 CORNER in case of any mail problems.

 When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.


IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step "1 through 6" or you will loose out on majority of
your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!


1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.


PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on
your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a
disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:


METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.


With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals
100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES
$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......
Grand Total=$555,550.00


NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on 
the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!


METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response.


We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all
orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.

=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always
send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

+++ If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks,
continue sending e-mails until you do. =orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT #2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until
you do.

+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different
report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you
can generate from this business!!!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works
exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers
you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, 
materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++
"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
"junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
"I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on
me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.
I have joined Jody in her "hobby".

Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back". "I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big".

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete
this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks".

How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, "Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, "Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?"

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No "hocus pocus" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minute presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.   Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          ***  801-294-3480  *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                          ***  801-294-3480  ***
