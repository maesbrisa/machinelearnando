Hi Bill!

Thank you for returning the paperwork to me. They are installing hardwoods
on 4th floor right now. (I was down there this am). The Lobby is
complete...just some touch up needed. Elevator is up & running.

At this time, we need you to identify a Lender and get yourself pre-approved
and have the Lender pre-approve the project. Because it is a conversion,
some Lenders have trouble doing the loan. Jerry Wilson of Pacific Northwest
Mortgage, Inc. has pre-approved this project and is doing a number of other
loans at the Roosevelt.
In case you'd like his number it is: 503-224-4564 or pager 503-224-4308
(Tell him you are calling re: Roosevelt).

Let me know which Lender you are working with and I will give them the
necessary info about the building.

Thanks,
Kirstin Boettcher for Jeff Burghart P.C.
The Hasson Company Realtors
503-735-4884

PS Didn't see ya walking for MS! :-) Late night? he he he

Electricity Deregulation is coming to Texas!
What a great way to start off the New Year - to be able to choose your electricity provider, which could mean potential savings for you and your family on your electric bill.  As you know, Enron has been a leader in lobbying for deregulation and a consumer's right to choose energy providers.

For the first time in our state's history, 5 percent of Texas households will have this golden opportunity.  The NewPower Company (NewPower), which is approximately 45 percent owned by Enron, was recently formed to provide energy and energy-related services to residential customers in deregulating energy markets across America, including Texas.  For a limited time, Houston-based employees will be eligible to participate in NewPower's pilot program offering their deregulated electric service.

Be Among the First to Participate:
Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.  If you would like more information about NewPower, visit the company's web site at www.newpower.com

Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, or any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.Message-ID: <3289278.1075844090815.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.
Marilyn

I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your 
participation in the Stanford Associate interviews last week.  Our efforts 
resulted in 6 summer associate offers and 1 full-time associate offer.  
Althea Gordon will be e-mailing you the names of the individuals who will 
receive offers.  We would like you to contact these individuals to 
congratulate them and encourage their acceptance.  Althea will match you up 
with the candidates you interviewed and provide you with contact information.

Althea has verbally contacted both the offers and the declines.  We will be 
sending out both offer letters and decline letters by end of day Tuesday, 
March 20.  In the meantime, should any of you be contacted by students who 
did not receive an offer, I recommend the following verbal response:

"Our summer program is highly competitive, forcing us to choose a smaller 
number of candidates from a highly qualified pool.  Our summer hiring this 
year will be between 35-40 associates.  The full-time program typically hires 
between 80-90 associates.  Given that you made it this far in our selection 
process, I would strongly encourage you to apply in the fall for the 
full-time associate program."

We will keep you informed via e-mail of our acceptance rate at Stanford.

Again, thank you for your support.  We look forward to working with you on 
potential future Stanford recruiting events.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

How have you progressed with finding us candidates for controller and back 
office?  The sooner we can get these people on board the better.  I sense we 
are falling a bit behind here in relation to some of the other functions.

Subject: Unify performance problem on Wednesday

As you are aware, the Unify system experienced significant performance 
problems Wednesday from approx 9:30 am - 11:20 am.  The duration of the 
problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before.  
The problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking 
that a fresh login might work better.  Additional logins never improve 
performance and generally degrade it, but that is another story.  (There was 
actually a single user with 21 sessions!)  We had to "bounce" the server 
twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance.

The good news is that we found out what caused the problem.  It was not a 
particular user or a particular report or process.  It was actually an 
intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in 
the past, but this particular change had drastic side effects.  We have 
contacted Sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the 
behavior is a "feature" or a bug.  In the meanwhile, we will do these types 
of changes at night during scheduled outages.

I apologize for the frustration, anxiety, and extra work brought on by this 
problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again.  
If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to give me a 
call.

Dave N.

That would be terrific!  I am right-handed and would like to borrow your

Michelle,
 
I called the Brookside Country Club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs.  Unfortunately, they do not have clubs to rent out. 
They suggested, if possible, you borrow a set from a friend.  
 
I'm not sure if renting from a friend is possible, but I do have a set
of clubs you could borrow.  They aren't the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age, but I would be glad to let you borrow them. 
Please give me a call if you are interested and I will bring them to the
golf outing.

Hello Vince, Stinson,

Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a
very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very
informative.

As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below
a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program
in place and rolling, and start the students working on it.
It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was
and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.

If I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August,
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize
the problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe,
who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate
the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest
to Enron.  The plan is this:

1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem
space.

2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of
good problems of:
a) high practical importance
b) high innovation potential
c) serious scope.

3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to:
a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback
b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact
c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy
and execution path.

I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so
that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his
doctoral work in this area.

I'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of
starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these
research issues!

Talk to you soon.
Best Regards,

Nick

Beginning this week, we are actively testing the changes to Path Manager to 
receive real-time deal updates from Sitara.  To prepare for this, we would 
like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick 
walkthru/training of the new features sometime early next week.  This should 
only take about 30 minutes.  Once they are comfortable with the features and 
performance, and once the testing is complete, we would like to migrate this 
to Unify Production either next week or the week after.  This should give us 
an adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week.

Once it is migrated to Production, we can either roll it out to all 
schedulers or to selected schedulers via security.

Heather, could you please schedule some time with the designated schedulers, 
Scotty, and myself early next week.  A room with a projector would work best.

Thanks, d.n.Message-ID: <2176183.1075855002046.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Hi Shirley,

thanks for corresponding with Carol during my absence, and confirming our
meeting with Vince Kaminski at 1:30 on May 4th.  I have a question about
the logistics.  I believe Dr. Kaminski has received an invitation to an
event in Houston: new Stanford president John Hennessy is visiting a number
of cities on a "welcome tour," and it just so happens he is hosting a
luncheon in Houston on May 4th.  If Dr. Kaminski wants to attend the
Hennessy Welcome Tour luncheon, Donna Lawrence and I could meet with him at
1:30 somewhere in the hotel.  If he's not attending the presidential event,
please let me know where you are located, and we'll plan travel time
accordingly.

Regards,
Susan

Subject: possibly adding deal prices to Path Manager

Donna,

A request was brought up this week that I would like you to run by the 
managers for input:
 - add the deal price to the Sales and Supply list windows of Path Manager
This seems more significant based on the transactions from EOL.

This has been mentioned in the past, but has had some related "baggage":
 - impact on performance, may run slower.  Could make it an option so you pay 
the price when you need it.
 - ability to show tier info.  Maybe just use the work "Tiered" and not try 
to represent the actual pricing
 - agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and 
fixed price offset (ie 98% of IF.Transco.ZN1 + .02)

This column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user 
preference.

Let me know what you hear.  d.n.

Stacey,

It looks like your missing paths revealed a quirk in our suppression of zero 
paths.  There were 4 paths initially entered as zero, then changed to 
non-zero on a later date.  The system did not correctly determine that the 
zero path should no longer be suppressed.

We have fixed the 4 paths affected and have corrected the code so this won't 
happen any more.  Below is a screen print of the Nov 22 problem that is now 
fixed.

I have been at Enron for eight months and work under Sally Beck.

In December I attended the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference, where I met 
Masayuki Fujita from the Mitsubishi Research Institute.  He is doing research 
on the deregulation of the Japanese power market.  We had lunch together and 
chatted for some time about his work (I worked in a Japanese company for 8 
1/2 years and speak fluent Japanese, so we got along easily).

He was in Houston this week and came by to visit.  On Monday, we met with 
Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson and later had dinner with them.  Sally 
suggested that I introduce him to Alan Aronowitz and you.  Of course, you 
were out of town, but we did meet with Alan who said you would probably want 
to meet him back in Tokyo anyway.

Would you like for me to set something up?

Regards,

Nick,

The airport is about 30 minutes  by cab from the office (1400 Smith).
The best hotel is either Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree 
Downtown (it is important to emphasize Downtown when making
reservations). The hotels are within a walking distance
from  the Enron building.

We can make reservations  for dinner around 6:30 - 7:00
in a resturant  within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.

By the way, we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related 
expenses.

Vince

Vince,

Yes, that would be ideal. But let me call first my travel agent to
see if there is a flight that would satisfy all the other
constraints. What time should I be at Enron on Thursday, and how far is
the airport from your offices?

Thanks,

Nick

NOTICE FROM SANTA:

I regret to inform you that effective immediately, I will no longer be
able
to serve the Southern United States on Christmas Eve.  Due to the
overwhelming population of the earth, my contract was renegotiated by
North
American Fairies and Elves Local #209.  I now serve only certain areas
of
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan.  As part of the new and
better contract, I also get longer breaks for milk and cookies, so keep
that
in mind.

Not to worry-I am certain that your children will be in good hands with
your
local replacement who happens to be my third cousin, Bubba Claus.  His
side
of the family is from the South Pole.  He shares my goal of delivering
toys
to all the good boys and girls.  However, there are a few differences
between us such as:

1.  There is no danger of The Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba
Claus.  He has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads:
"These toys insured by Smith and Wesson."

2.  Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave
an
RC cola and pork rinds [or a moon pie] on the fireplace and Bubba
doesn't
smoke a pipe.  He dips a little snuff though, so please have an empty
spit
can handy.

3.  Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared, flyin' coon dogs
instead
of reindeer.  I made the mistake of loaning him a couple of my reindeer
one
time, and Blitzen's head now overlooks Bubba's fireplace.

4.  You won't hear "On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen..." when
Bubba
Claus arrives.  Instead, you'll hear, "On Earnhardt, on Wallace, on
Martin
and Labonte.  On Rudd, on Jarrett, on Elliott and Petty."

5.  "Ho, ho, ho!" has been replaced by "Yee Haw!" And you also are
likely to
hear Bubba's elves respond, "I her'd dat!"

6.  As required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have
a
Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words "Back off". The
last
I heard it also had other decorations on the sleigh as well. One is a
Ford
logo with lights that race through the letters, and the other is a
caricature of me (Santa Claus) peeing on the Tooth Fairy.

7.  The usual Christmas movie classics such as "Miracle on 34th Street"
and
"It's a Wonderful Life" will not be shown in your negotiated viewing
area.
Instead, you'll see "Boss Hog Saves Christmas" and "Smokey and the
Bandit
IV" featuring Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state police
cars
crashing into each other.

8.  Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. If I were you, I'd make sure the
wife
and the kids turn the other way when he bends over to put presents under
the
tree.

9.  And finally, lovely Christmas songs have been sung about me like
"Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer" and Bing Crosby's "Santa Claus Is
Coming to
Town."   This year songs about Bubba Claus will be played on all the AM
radio stations in the South.  Those song titles will be Mark Chesnutt's
"Bubba Claus Shot the Jukebox", Cledus T. Judd's "All I Want for
Christmas
Is My Woman and a Six Pack", and Johnny Paycheck's "If You Don't Like
Bubba
Claus, Shove It."

Sincerely Yours, Santa Claus, (Member) North American Fairies and Elves
Local #209

Also meant to tell you that Nicole Schwartz left Compaq last week and will
start at Enron this next Monday.  Look her up after she gets settled in.  I
told her you were there too.  Did you know her?  She worked for Linda a
while back, then transferred to campus on a special project with Michael
Takemura.  Then out of that to another group with Lisa Kaiser.
Just an FYI -

Dear Celeste and Stinson,

I am writing to refuse Enron's offer for a summer position.  After several
conversations with my advisor at Stanford, we have decided that I should
remain at Stanford to work on my dissertation.

Thank you again for taking the time to show me around Enron.

good... Thank you.  

Also, we (GPG) do not have a standard for Palm Pilots.. actually, from what 
I've found it doesn't look like they are leaning towards Palm Pilots.. Can 
Michelle wait for the standard? or we can just order her one now.   I'll 
still trying to get a time frame for this standard.   I'l ask again today.

Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month

Hi Vince, Stinson

Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet
with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very
productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more
clearly.

We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships 
(RA)
for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support
on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to
start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental
requirement.

Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can
do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having
pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September,
just before school starts.

I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous
e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please,
let me know how you would like to proceed.

Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive 
collaboration
during the coming year and beyond.

Best Regards,

Nick


PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area
in October.

It's that time or year again!!!


Once there was a season when Texas and A & M football teams were not
scheduled to play each other.

It seemed so unusual, that the coaches of both teams got together and
decided that there should be some sort of competition between the 2 teams
because of their great rivalry.

They decided on a week long ice-fishing competition.
The team who caught the most fish at the end of the week would win.

So on a cold northern South Dakota lake (a neutral site so no one would
whine about home field advantage), they began their contest.

The 1st day, after 8 hours of fishing, A&M had caught 100 fish and Texas
had 0.

At the end of the 2nd day, A&M had caught 200 fish and Texas had 0.

That evening the Texas Coach got his team together and said, "I suspect
some kind of cheating is taking place".

The next morning he dressed one of his players in maroon and white and sent
him over to the camp to act as a spy.

At the end of the day, the spy came back to report to the coach.

The coach asked, "Well, how about it, are the Aggies cheating?"

"They sure are", the Texas player reported, "They're cutting holes in the
ice!"

Subject: FW: Even For You 
Because in some ways, you have these traits and must 
do these things as well. 
Mother's Day 
If you send this to just one person, it should make it 
all the way around 
by Mother's Day. 
This is for all the mothers who have sat up all night 
with sick toddlers 
in their arms, wiping up barf laced with Oscar Mayer 
wieners and cherry 
Kool-Aid saying, "It's OK honey, Mommy's here." 
Who walk around the house all night with their babies 
when they keep 
crying and won't stop. 
This is for all the mothers who show up at work with 
spit-up in their 
hair and milk stains on their blouses and diapers in 
their purse. 
For all the mothers who run carpools and make cookies 
and sew Halloween 
costumes. And all the mothers who DON'T. 
This is for the mothers who gave birth to babies 
they'll never see. And 
the mothers who took those babies and gave them homes. 
This is for all the mothers who froze their buns off 
on metal bleachers 
at football or soccer games Friday night instead of 
watching from cars, so 
that when their kids asked, "Did you see me?" they 
could say, "Of course, I 
wouldn't have missed it for the world," and mean it. 
This is for all the mothers who yell at their kids in 
the grocery store 
and swat them in despair when they stomp their feet 
like a tired 2-year old 
who wants ice cream before dinner. 
This is for all the mothers who sat down with their 
children and 
explained all about making babies. And for all the 
mothers who wanted to but just couldn't. 
For all the mothers who read "Goodnight, Moon" twice a 
night for a year. 
And then read it again.  "Just one more time." 
This is for all the mothers who taught their children 
to tie their 
shoelaces before they started school. And for all the 
mothers who opted for Velcro instead. 
This is for all the mothers who teach their sons to 
cook and their 
daughters to sink a jump shot. 
This is for all mothers whose heads turn automatically 
when a little 
voice calls "Mom?" in a crowd, even though they know 
their own off spring are at home. 
This is for all the mothers who sent their kids to 
school with stomach 
aches, assuring them they'd be just FINE once they got 
there, only to get 
calls from the school nurse an hour later asking them 
to please pick them 
up.  Right away. 
This is for mothers whose children have gone astray, 
who can't find the 
words to reach them. 
For all the mothers who bite their lips sometimes 
until they bleed when 
their 14 year olds dye their hair green. 
What makes a good Mother anyway? 
Is it patience? 
Compassion? 
Broad hips? 
The ability to nurse a baby, cook dinner, and sew a 
button on a shirt, 
all at the same time? 
Or is it heart? Is it the ache you feel when you watch 
your son or 
daughter disappear down the street, walking to school 
alone for the very first 
time? 
The jolt that takes you from sleep to dread, from bed 
to crib at 2 A.M. 
to put your hand on the back of a sleeping baby? 
The need to flee from wherever you are and hug your 
child when you hear 
news of a fire, a car accident, a child dying? 
For all the mothers of the victims of all these school 
shootings, and the 
mothers of those who did the shooting. For the mothers 
of the survivors, 
and the mothers who sat in front of their TVs in 
horror, hugging their child 
who just came home from school, safely. 
This is for mothers who put pinwheels and teddy bears 
on their children's 
graves. 
This is for young mothers stumbling through diaper 
changes and sleep 
deprivation. 
And mature mothers learning to let go. 
For working mothers and stay-at-home mothers. 
Single mothers and married mothers. 
Mothers with money, mothers without. 
This is for you all. 
So hang in there. 
Please pass along to all the Mom's in your life. 
"Home is what catches you when you fall - and we all 
fall." 
Please pass this to all the wonderful mothers you 
know. 
(I just did)

Importance:=09High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possib=
ly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I wou=
ld like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask question=
s and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this informat=
ion with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic =
and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choo=
se, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordina=
tion efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening =
for a while though.

The sooner we get someone to devote to this, the better off we will be.  I =
expect these changes that we'll be looking into should improve performance =
quite a bit. =20

That being said, we've identified three items that would speed up processin=
g the retrieval of Path Manager. =20

1)  Currently, the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids.  I can't think =
of any reason why we need to perform this extra step?    It runs through th=
is processing on the application and generally doesn't find a match.  I kno=
w Patti has mentioned this several times and I can't think of a valid reaso=
n for performing this work.  I talked with Dave Nommensen, and according to=
 him, what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate =
paths out there which is why they put this code in place???  From a schedul=
ing perspective, my understanding of what your main concern is to just main=
tain your position and be able to change it.  If you were overpathed, you'd=
 see it in the Path Manager either way. [Pinion, Richard]    To restate the=
 question for clarity, in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply, mar=
ket and a service, adds any up/downstream contract information and/or Duns =
or DRN override and then saves it.  Unify looks for an old path with those =
exact variables and if it finds it re-uses it and if it does not find an ex=
act match creates a new path and path id.  I had been told that to do away =
with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since =
any path once nominated on could not be deleted.  Has this changed???  At o=
ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity=
 number match for nominations.  Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that ne=
eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer=
e used.  I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs =
this to occur.  Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number =
cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected=
.  Therefore, if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify, I =
don't think that this constant old path look up is needed.   [Kinsey, Lisa]=
   Get rid of this. =20

2)  The scheduling position window:  does anyone use this?  If not, we'll r=
emove the code logic that populates this window.  I have never seen a sched=
uler use this.  Please verify. [Pinion, Richard]   Originally such a window=
 was in use by everyone in the legacy system "Autonoms" so it was duplicate=
d in Unify by request.  It is not used in Unify now because of the other so=
phisticated tools Unify provides which obviate it's use.  The only value wo=
uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o=
ther ways to determine those problems.  As voted on in a previous meeting o=
f the managers - Lose it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Why is this still here?=09=20

3)  On the inventory pool list, does anyone need to see the Contarct Refere=
nces List?  Again, this code is called every retrieval time and doesn't app=
ear to be used from my observations.   If they do need this information, we=
 could provide it, but if not, I'd prefer to remove the functionality. [Pin=
ion, Richard]    This function is still very much in use by those with poin=
t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing =
nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat=
hed through the same contract imbalance pool.  Keep it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Ye=
s.  We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools.=09=20

4)  When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths, what's the aver=
age number of paths they create at one time?  What about updates?  I know t=
hat ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packa=
ges of gas that they are limited in size to.  Does the system seem faster w=
hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records?  My real question=
 is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and=
 Inserts.  By update, I mean, going to the path list and changing an upstre=
am / downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be cr=
eated. [Pinion, Richard]    This one to many or many to one pathing goes on=
 every day on every pipeline.  There is no 'average'.  They typically updat=
e a path with up/downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how=
ever.  I hope this answers your question.  I see no change to this process =
at this time  [Kinsey, Lisa]  On some pipes this function is used more than=
 others.  When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible.  At this=
 time I do not see a need to change this process. =09=20

5)  On brokered paths, do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Se=
rvice?  In other words, when updating Brokered arrangements, we don't incor=
porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm=
ent link and hence sending it to be renominated?  Why do we do this for ser=
vice?  Is it because we have to renominate it?  I assume that's what it's f=
or since we don't send brokered paths to the pipe.  Anyway, with the Nomlog=
ic implmentation (two way interface), we were planning on having it behave =
the same way as service.  We need this verified. [Pinion, Richard]    We do=
n't perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominat=
ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi=
peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path.  I =
don't see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time=
. [Kinsey, Lisa]  Agree with Richard.=09=20

Subject: Re: Sitara positions, end of month feedback from Unify  

Please take note of Dave's very important  message regarding Sitara 
positions. We absolutely cannot afford to go through this again and need to 
do everything  possible to help limit the exposure. With prices where they 
are and winter weather upon us we will most likely have a very challenging 
bid week. 

That being said I want each of you to make sure we adhere to the "daily 
clean" process. You should pull all the necessary reports each day and keep 
after the schedulers to make sure they are up to date. If you wish, Donna and 
Richard can make these available each day and distribute to the group. We 
don't have much time so this needs to happen immediately.

Donna, please provide me with a daily summary of all the desks for the 
remainder of the month. 


Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, thanks - Bob

Subject: Sitara positions, end of month feedback from Unify

Bob, et al,

As I am sure you recall, we had a problem with Sitara positions earlier in 
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to CPR for positions.  
Although I have not gotten very far in my transition off of Unify and onto 
Sitara and TDS, we do see some potential for this happening again towards the 
end of this month and the beginning of next month.

The problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts, 
along with updates to those deals.  A large portion of these updates come to 
Sitara via the Unify Bridge Back process.  It would be ideal if we could 
continue to have the Unify data "cleaned/scrubbed" week to week and try to 
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated/bridged in the final 
week/days of the month.  I know this is the goal of Logistics, but I just 
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on 
the Gas Trading systems.  Perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the Pipeline 
Exception Summary and the Bridge Back Pipeline Summary in Unify this month 
would help.

Another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to 
have 2 months "active" at a time.  In other words, when November is over and 
we are in the first week or two of December, Sitara continues to maintain 
positions for November.  This November data degrades the ability to update 
December positions in a timely manner.  We may find ourselves having to 
remove the November deals from the Sitara positions sooner than we have in 
the past.

I will be trying to work with the Sitara team in the coming days/weeks to 
implement some combination of quick fixes, as well as look into the long term 
changes necessary to support our increased trading business.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area.

Thanks, d.n.

Hello Nick:

I agree  e-mail is much easier.

There is a two-hour time difference between Calif and Texas, i.e., 1:00 pm 
Texas Time - 11:00 am Calif time.

Would tomorrow at 11:00 am Calif time be ok with you (1:00 pm Texas)?  
This time is fine for Vince, Tom Gros and Stinson Gibner.

Can they call you and if so, what number?

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley,

It's easier to communcate by e-mail, since I am moving from
meeting to meeting (but I have the laptop always with me).

Please give me a phone number that I could call tomorrow.
What is the time difference between California and your
location? I think it's 2 hours (CA->TX) - is that right?

I can do the conference call any time from 9-11 CA time.
Would that be OK on your side?


Thanks,

Nick

Yes, it's the largest time of the year!  :)
===========================================

>I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the
holidays without gaining 10 pounds.
>
>You can't pick up a magazine without finding a list of holiday eating
do's and don'ts. Eliminate second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies
made with butter, they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say.
>
>Good grief. Is your favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot
stick?  I didn't think so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you
left for Rudolph.
>
>I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you
follow them, you'll be fat and happy.
>
>So what if you don't make it to New Year's? Your pants won't fit
anymore,anyway.
>
>1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on a
holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In fact, if
you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where they're serving rum
balls.
>
>2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine single-malt
scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than single-malt scotch. You
can't find it any other time of year but now. So drink up! Who cares
that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's not as if you're going to
turn into an eggnogaholic or something. It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for
me.  Have two. It's later than you think. It's Christmas!
>
>3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of
gravy.  Gravy does not stand alone. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your
mashed potatoes. Fill it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat.
>
>4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk or
whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a sports
car with an automatic transmission.
>
>5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control
your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat
other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college?
>
>6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New
Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. This
is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the buffet table
while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog.
>
>7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like
frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position
yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before becoming
the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of shoes. You can't
leave them behind. You're not going to see them again.
>
>8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. Or,
if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. Always have
three. When else do you get to have more than one dessert? Labor Day?
>
>9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the
mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, have some
standards, mate.
>
>10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the
party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. Reread
tips.  Start over.
>

To clarify the memo that I sent yesterday concerning Buyer vs. Seller on 
Intercompany deals, I want to make sure that everyone understands that not 
only will the Seller side post on the SITARA deal but that the Volume 
Feedback Reconciliation report  will reflect the error(s) associated with the 
buy side as well.  It will no longer show the the error(s) generated by the 
sales side as it currently does.  This change will coincide with the way SAP 
reports Intercompany transactions.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Note: The Volume Feedback Reconciliation report is the report which I 
distribute on a daily basis.

Thanks,
RHP

Subject: Buyer vs. Seller on Intercompany Deals

It has been brought to my attention that SAP will not use the Buyer as the 
governing value associated with Intercompany deals but the Seller.  
Currently, SITARA captures the volume bridged back on the buy side not the 
sales side.  I wanted to make sure that those of you who would be impacted by 
the change were aware of how SITARA would reflected the volumes associated 
with Intercompany deals.  If there are any concerns with this, please let me 
know as soon as possible.  I will need to have an adjustment made to the 
Volume Feedback Reconciliation report to reflect this change once it has been 
finalized.   It may be a month or two before this is implemented but I wanted 
to make sure everyone had advance notice.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at X39222.

Hi Vince,

Unfortunately, I have not heard from him.  He also forwarded his resume to Mauricio Mora, who asked if we could interview him.  When I asked Celeste about it back then she decided against it.  If you need some help tracking him down, let me know.  

Thanks,

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

Best regards,

Dannetta is at 1100 Louisiana (your old Tennessee Building).  Is that the
one on the tunnel level?  What time will we need to be there to get a seat?
That will be fine with me.  I'll let Danetta know.

In order to provide the appropriate degree of coordination and feedback, we 
will begin to have weekly conference calls regarding progress towards putting 
in place Enron Japan.  These will commence this week and run each week until 
further notice.  If you are unable to attend please send a representative.  
The call will be conducted as below:

Houston Thursday 4pm
London  Thursday 10pm
Tokyo  Friday  7am
Sydney  Friday  9am

A call in number will be provided later this week as well as a meeting room 
for those in Houston.  I have also added a summary sheet that I would ask all 
to fill out and send in the day before the meeting.  By sticking to this 
general summary form (1 page), we will be handle to keep the calls brief and 
to the point.  I would not expect the calls to last more than 1 hour.

Wanda -

FYI, Joe Hirl, the trader in charge of setting up the Tokyo trading office, 
will be in Houston next week, and it would probably be a good idea if he 
could interview Mark Frank, or whatever candidate we recommend for the 
Controller position.   Our Controller for the Sydney office will be up the 
following week and he should meet with her as well, as that will enable him 
to get first hand knowledge of the remote trading office establishment issues 
we've addressed in Australia.

Sally - did you decide on the one candidate you thought of when we met last?  
We might want to arrange a meeting with him and Joe also.

Thanks,

In the West, the relationship between regulators and businesses is based on 
control (and sometimes conflict -- somewhat like prison guard vs. inmates).  
Nevertheless, in Japan, it has until recently been based on cooperation (more 
like a coach and team).

The Japanese understand that this relationship may not be the best for the 
nation as a whole and have begun changing it.  This process is disconcerting 
and has powerful emotions attached to it.

I thought you might find this article interesting, since it shows some of the 
complexities inherent in this change that might not be readily apparent to 
Westerners.

Regards,



Eugenio

Vince (and Shirley and Melinda),

Thanks so much for including me in this meeting with Stanford engineering---unfortunately, I'm committed to participate in the Enron Law Conference in San Antonio that entire day.

Thanks!

Dear Vince,

this is great news!  Donna and I are delighted that you have time to see us
on May 4th.

I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my
assistant, Carol Lovell, I will ask her to get in touch with Shirley for
scheduling as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to
meet with Christie Patrick as well.

Looking forward to meeting you,

Susan

Dr. Kaminski, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and 
me
during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing 
short
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the 
people,
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in
Stanford during the last weekend of February. I will send you an email next
week, so that we can arrange a meeting between you and Prof. Bambos.
All the best wishes,

Giuseppe

Hi Sally

  Thanks for the attached.  In light of your response I think I'm after 2 
things:

   1. A spec that outlines Eugenio's role, and
  
   2. A spec that could be used to hire a Japanese national to replace 
Eugenio at the end of Eugenio's assignment in Japan.

  Hope this helps. If you could revert asap I'd appreciate it.

  Thanks

  Phil

I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the 
attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do 
with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to 
create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in 
Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a 
position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use 
in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the 
risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different 
descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use 
this.  

Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you.

Michelle,
?
I called the Brookside Country Club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs.? Unfortunately, they do not have clubs to rent out.?
They suggested, if possible, you borrow a set from a friend.? 
?
I'm not sure if renting from a friend is possible, but I do have a set
of clubs you could borrow.? They aren't the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age, but I would be glad to let you borrow them.?
Please give me a call if you are interested and I will bring them to the
golf outing.

at another time.

I still have 1:30 as the time for Vince and Susan to meet.

Susan,

Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to meet with you on May the 4th.
I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713) 853 5290, to call you to set 
up the meeting.

Also, for your information, we have recently set up a special unit to 
coordinate Enron's
relationships with the universities. The person running this unit is Christie 
Patrick.
Please, feel free to contact her and give my name as a reference. I shall 
coordinate the meeting
on May  the 4th with her.

Subject: Visit from Stanford?


Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations
for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.

I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with
Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip
to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the
university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to
include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,
May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip
planning.

The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities
in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact.

I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,

Sincerely,
Susan Hansen

Hello Michelle,

My name is Joelene Whittaker and I am a recruiter with STM Associates. DTE Energy, www.dtecs.com/sitemap.html, has retained us to assist them in placing two Director of Sales for Eastern and Western Regions. The Eastern position will be located in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the Western position in Denver, Colorado.  Both Director of Sales will report to the Vice President of Sales.

Qualifications of this position include a minimum of 5 years of sales experience and an additional minimum of 2 years experience with a trading company is preferred.  The successful candidate will have a strong understanding of U.S. Coal, Transportation and Electric Utility industries, including coal tolling, marketing and origination functions used in support of coal trading operations.  Solid experience in finding ways to capitalize on opportunities in the coal and transportation business is a must.  A background which includes Senior-level contract negotiations is required.

We are asking for recommendations from coal trading executives within the energy  industry.  Would you take a moment to consider colleagues whose experience fits DTE's profile and who you would deem as a high caliber candidate for the position.  

I appreciate any help you may provide and look forward to hearing from you.  I can be reached at (801)531-6500 or via e-mail jwhittaker@stmassociates.com.

Regards,
Joelene Whittaker

The "partying Lokay's" - what a wild family!!!!? Does Chuck E. Cheese have a 
New Year's party planned?? Of course we will spend New Year's with you if we 
are in town.? We have the air mattress at the house there, so we will be okay 
as far as a place to stay.? 

I asked Caroline the other day if she would like to go to the FunPlex with 
Emily this Saturday, and she said, "Meghan!"

What are you guys doing on New Year's?? If you're in Houston and want to 
spend it with the "partying Lokay's," we're available.? Maybe you can even 
stay with us! 

Use michelle.lokay@enron.com for the emails (Scott's email is 
scott.goodell@enron.com).? They are in the process of changing all our
email addresses to the longer ones.

Thanks for the offer for Urban Retreat...count me in!

Not too bad so far - of course, first day is kind of boring, and not a lot 
of people in the office.? We get out at noon tomorrow and are off Monday 
and Tuesday. 

I am not sure when we will be back - you can mail the pics if you want to, 
or wait.? I have some also, but the Christmas ones are on a new roll that 
is not finished yet.? I am guessing we will either be in Houston or Dallas 
at New Year's.

Should I use Michelle.Lokay@enron.com for your address, or is mlokay okay? 
(it rhymes!)? Also, what is Scott Goodell's e-mail - it came back to me? 

Hope to see you soon, and have a great Christmas.? Oh yeah, would you be 
interested in the pedicure I have left on my Urban Retreat gift 
certificate?? I never got around to using it.

As a follow up on our meeting last week, I'm working with Rick Causey and 
CAOs for ENA and Enron Europe to identify potential candidates and to refine 
our job description for the local hire we want to recruit permanently.  Rick 
wants to be closely involved in those decisions.  Would you please forward to 
me some of the handouts you had with you or may have updated by now that 
address the business environment, Gantt chart/timeline, office scope, timing 
of business transactions etc. to aid in communicating Tokyo needs?  I'm not 
sure if you sent anything to Sally, but I don't believe I've seen anything 
yet.

Thank you,

A man asked his wife what she'd like for her birthday.

"I'd love to be six again," she replied.

On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off
they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every
ride in the park:  the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear-
everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the
theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a
McDonald's they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along
with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a
movie - the latest Star Wars!

What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband
and collapsed into bed.

He leaned over and lovingly asked, "Well, dear; what was it like being
six again?"

One eye opened, "You idiot, I meant my dress size."

The moral of this story is:  If a woman speaks and a man is there to
hear her, he will get it wrong anyway.Message-ID: <7455601.1075855878914.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Trying to Restore Confidence in Enron to Salvage a Merger

November 28, 2001 

By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


 

The Enron Corporation (news/quote) and Dynegy Inc.
(news/quote) worked yesterday to find ways to bolster
confidence in Enron's weakened energy- trading business as
the companies' negotiators continued talks on revising the
terms of their merger, executives close to the talks said. 

The renegotiated deal would cut the value of the
acquisition by half, they said, to roughly $4 billion.
Dynegy, they said, was also prepared to invest at least an
additional $250 million in Enron, on top of the $1.5
billion cash infusion from Dynegy's biggest investor,
ChevronTexaco, included in the initial deal announced Nov.
9. But Dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets, and
the companies were trying to identify and value enough
Enron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditors,
the executives said. 

Before a series of financial disclosures sent Enron's stock
into collapse and the company into the arms of Dynegy, its
Houston rival, Enron's natural gas and electricity trading
floors did more business than the two largest competitors
combined. They also accounted for the majority of Enron's
profits by far. 

But traders and Wall Street analysts said the business had
steadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths of
Enron's financial straits. Many traders have curtailed
dealings with Enron, and the executives close to the talks
said Dynegy officials scouring Enron's books were having
difficulty this week figuring out how much cash the trading
operation was generating. 

The executives close to the talks said that the
renegotiated terms for Dynegy's acquisition of Enron would
lower the price to about 0.13 Dynegy share for each share
of Enron, cutting by half the value of the deal announced
Nov. 9, when Dynegy offered 0.2685 share. If a deal is
struck at 0.13 Dynegy share, at yesterday's closing prices,
Dynegy would be paying about $5.32 an Enron share, a 29.4
percent premium over Enron's diminished stock price. The
premium was 20.6 percent over Enron's closing price on the
day that the deal was announced. 

Both companies are seeking promises from Enron's bank
lenders to extend debt repayment dates until after the
merger closes. And they are also discussing adding
provisions that could limit Dynegy's ability to back out of
the combination. 

The two companies are also working to arrange a cash
infusion of $500 million from J. P. Morgan Chase
(news/quote) and Citigroup (news/quote) that would provide
Enron with desperately needed new cash. 

But there is growing concern that the cash infusion from
the banks will not calm investors' fears or reassure energy
traders, leading Dynegy to seek an additional $500 million
in cash for Enron. Late yesterday, the two companies were
hung up over whether Enron, which has already used many of
its most prized assets as collateral for loans, has enough
assets left to serve as collateral for the additional
money, according to executives close to the talks. 

A number of Enron assets were being examined, including
some that have already been used to obtain other loans, the
executives said. The assets include: Transwestern Pipeline,
a major natural gas pipeline that links the gas-producing
basins of Texas and the Southwest with California; Enron's
stake in other gas- pipeline assets; its 9.8 percent stake,
worth about $400 million, in EOG Resources (news/quote), a
former subsidiary that is now an independent publicly
traded oil and gas company; and its indirect stake in
Hanover Compressor, which manufactures equipment used to
increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its
flow on interstate pipelines. 

Yesterday, investors anxiously awaited a report by Moody's
Investors Service, which like other major credit-rating
firms, currently ranks Enron's debt at the lowest
investment-grade level. If Enron were to lose its
investment-grade status, it could be forced to repay or
refinance up to $3.9 billion in debt, while other traders
would probably further curtail business. But by late
yesterday, Moody's (news/quote) decided not to issue a
statement after receiving assurances from Enron and Dynegy
officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon,
the executives said. A Moody's spokesman declined comment. 

Executives close to the talks said that they hoped that
new cash from Dynegy would reassure both Wall Street and
the energy-trading markets that Enron's trading floor would
survive and remain a valuable asset. 

But analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring
how much value the trading operation has already lost, and
how much the business has been reduced because of credit
concerns. 

"I believe Dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in
the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase
price as a result," said Andre Meade, head of United States
utilities research for Commerzbank Securities in New York.
"I don't think anyone can estimate the earning power of
Enron over the next three to four quarters, and I'm not
sure Enron has a good estimate." 

Mr. Meade said he did not believe that Dynegy's earlier
estimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to
its earnings was "reliable today, given how sharply the
business seems to have deteriorated." By Mr. Meade's
calculations, if Enron's trading volumes were to fall 50
percent next year - even if normal volume growth levels
returned in 2003 - that would wipe out nearly all the value
in the stock. 

Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said the company had
experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the
number of traders doing business with it, but both
stabilized yesterday. She declined to elaborate or quantify
the decline. 

She also said that Enron's trading operation remained
profitable, though she could not quantify it, and she also
said she did not know whether the company was working on a
possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans
should its business and liquidity worsen. "We're moving
forward with the merger," she said. 

Dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday.


Shares of Enron rose yesterday on news of a possible
revised acquisition agreement. They closed at $4.11, up 2.5
percent, or 10 cents. Shares of Dynegy closed at $40.89, up
4.2 percent, or $1.64. 

Though yesterday's gains halted a four-day slide in Enron
shares, the stock is down 95 percent this year after
disclosures of major losses as well as significant
accounting errors that led Enron to admit it overstated
profits during the last five years by nearly $600 million. 

Now, difficulties within Enron's trading operation are
exacerbating the company's overall liquidity problems in
three ways, according to some analysts and rival
energy-trading executives. 

First, other traders are requiring Enron to put up greater
margin on its trades. On top of that, in some cases Enron's
traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas
than traders at other companies. This credit premium in
some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for
every million British thermal units of gas Enron buys,
these people say. 

Additionally, many traders, like the Mirant Corporation
(news/quote), have either scaled back or stopped doing
business with Enron, hurting its trading revenue. 

Mr. Meade of Commerzbank said "end-use customers and
trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business
to competitors as a result of Enron's credit concerns and
are reluctant to increase their exposures to Enron."

Danny has provided us with some tickets to the 2002 Olympic Winter Games Reception celebrating the Olympic Torch Relay in Houston today.  We have VIP Seating and tickets to the VIP Area (although I'm not sure what this means).  If you (and your spouse) would like to attend a private reception tonight at 6:30pm at the Renaissance Houston Hotel - 6 Greenway Plaza East (Edloe @ Hwy 59) please let me know.  John and I will be there and we have tickets for two more interested folks.   

Also, the Olympic Torch is being run in front of my home, The Spires, tonight between 5:00 and 5:30pm.  You all are welcome to come over and see this event.  I will try to leave the office around 4:15 to head home.  Please let me know if you would like to come, I will give you directions.

Thanks, Kim. Message-ID: <19448954.1075855879205.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

John,

I have an early call , but am free from 9-10 Sydney time (2 hours ahead of 
you).  I am then free again from 1pm local time onwards.  Do any of these 
times work?  If they don't then perhaps we can speak while you are in PI.

back in the states
and won't be back until Thursday next week.  I am off to the Phillipines 
tomorrow afternoon 
at 1pm and will be gone until Friday afternoon.  Could we do this first thing

Subject: EOL for Japan

As you are probably aware, we are looking at a roll out time for bringing the 
international commodities on EOL to Japan before the end of this month.  We 
have planned for a public rollout between 10-12 May.  The mailout for this is 
expected to be sent out the third week of April.

As all the products initially posted will be handled through the Singapore 
books, we need to make sure everything is in line.  We will not be offering 
any domestic products until probably third quarter.  Legal has been reviewing 
the nature and form of the Japanese law and has found that in its current 
form we should be able to roll out the system without too much difficulty.  
We will be using standard international contract forms which you would expect 
the cp's in Japan to be comfortable with.  In addition to your support for 
the range of petroleum products, Sydney will also quote your USD prices in 
Yen.  I spoke with Hickerson last week and they are making preparations for 
this.  With Sydney only 1 hour ahead, this allows Shane to provide real time 
support throughout the business day in Japan.

I would suggest that we have a call in the next day or so to further 
discuss.  Would tomorrow at 2pm Sydney time work?  I believe that this is 
noon your time?  If this doesn't work let me know so that we can adjust.

thanks,

Joe

I found another web site regarding travel rights as a consumer from the US Department of Transportation.
http://www.dot.gov/airconsumer/flyrights.htm
The sections on delayed/canceled flights and overbooked are of interest.

* If you are bumped involuntarily and the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to get you to 
your final destination (including later connections) within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time, there is no compensation. 

If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your destination between one and 
two hours after your original arrival time (between one and four hours on international flights), the airline must pay you an amount
 equal to your one-way fare to your final destination, with a $200 maximum. 

* If the substitute transportation is scheduled to get you to your destination more than two hours later (four hours internationally), 
or if the airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements for you, the compensation doubles (200% of your fare, 
$400 maximum). 

* You always get to keep your original ticket and use it on another flight. If you choose to make your own arrangements, 
you can request an "involuntary refund" for the ticket for the flight you were bumped from. The denied boarding compensation
 is essentially a payment for your inconvenienceMessage-ID: <13192403.1075844170406.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms "Tom's words of warning" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).


(Dave - feel free to chime in if I left anything out.)

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

Desk Managers, 

I will be issuing a small laminated version of the attached list of contacts for escalation of Unify and EDI issues in a small laminated version.  The objective in putting Richard first on the list is to address any issues that are business related or education related prior to getting IT folks involved; thereby, freeing up our IT folks to work on programming fixes and enhancements.  

<<EscalationProcedures.xls>> 

After implementation, if you feel these escalation procedures are not providing the level of support your desk requires, please let me know.

All,

When we convert Unify to Sybase 12.0, all passwords will get reset to 
"houston".  Once you login to Unify you will have to change you password.  
This is an unavoidable side affect of migrating to Sybase 12.0.

I have included four files.  They are labeled as to what they are.  The
color files reflect the original's sepia tone, the B&W ones should be
obvious.  The 72dpi would be the ones to email for people to look at on the
computer (should show up as full sized on most screens) and the 300dpi would
be ok for printing.  If you want to use the picture for desktop wallpaper,
let me know your screen resolution (i.e. 1024x768); I will make a file
special for that.

During mid-july, SITARA will change the logic on Desk to Desk deals to post 
the volume associated with the Sales (Seller) side to the SITARA deal.  
Currently, the volume on the Receipt (Buyer) side is being posted.  This 
change will be implemented in order to coincide with the logic currently 
being used in SAP.  This change should help to avoid Intercompany imbalances.

Please be aware that this change will effect Desk to Desk deals only.  The 
logic on Transport Usage deals will remain as it is currently - Delivery 
Point (To) - posts to the SITARA deal.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at X39222.

of offenses. Call the option many things: plain, boring, ancient, uninspire=
d.
But when Nebraska runs it, it=01,s cruel and usual punishment for opposing
defenses.

Teams may be able to slow it down, but over the course of four quarters, th=
ey
will pay a price, slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages 303
pounds. Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in
January? That was Tennessee=01,s defense after the Cornhuskers drove 99 yar=
ds in
the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl.

The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current
rage of defenses using quick, blitzing attacks. Sure, you can send everybod=
y
after the ball, but the option demands you stop and think and play an
assignment. How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see
only once a year? The answer is you don=01,t.

Arguably, the Cornhuskers, FOXSports.com's No. 1 team in its preseason Top
25, were playing the best football in the country by the end of the 1999
season. In their last five games, the Cornhuskers beat Texas A&M, Kansas
State, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of 164-72. The
scary thing about Nebraska is that 10 offensive starters return for a team
that finished 12-1 last season.

The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again. It starts
in the off-season and continues through January. The running game took a
while to materialize last season because of injuries, but I-back Dan
Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for 1,000
yards this season. Even if the oft-injured Alexander can=01,t hold up to th=
e
pounding, the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a
fitting name for this smashmouth football team: Thunder Collins.

Nebraska will not only push other teams around. The Cornhuskers will push
themselves. The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic
Raiola for the Outland Trophy, presented to the nation's outstanding interi=
or
lineman. The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense.

"This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an=
d
September," said Nebraska coach Frank Solich, who has his best team since
taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago. "We have a rich history and a
team coming off a good season that is not questioning things.

"We have high expectations. Some of it comes from how we finished last
season. A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition."

The option and the 'Huskers are inextricably bound. It is their offense, an=
d
they have been running it so long it is practically an open-book test for
defensive coordinators. Yet, only eight teams have passed the test over the
last seven years. Nebraska has won 81 games and three national titles in th=
at
span.

"We try to keep up with what=01,s current and we use the spring to experime=
nt,"
Solich said. "But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you. Our
players that are here love it. It is an aggressive style of play and that=
=01,s
how they want to play it. It=01,s what our players want to do on offense."

The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged. Crouch can put
his name up there with the Turner Gill, Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for
the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever, but all bets are off for this
team if Crouch is hurt, because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback.

The schedule has its pitfalls too. Notre Dame, looking for a win that can
restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie, gets Nebraska at home =
on
Sept. 9. A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska =
at
their places. Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan.

The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big 12
championship game, which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish.

The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike
Brown. But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense. Polk is
heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history.

But come January 3, Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title=
.
And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack.

Vince,

  I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.
If you'd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.

Frank Wolak

Nick,

Hope you had a nice Christmas.  Best wishes for the New Year.  =20

It would certainly be great to see you and to meet Eric some time in the ne=

few months.     Everyone here
was very impressed with Giuseppe and we are eager to have another of your=

Enron Broadband is continuing to evolve and the current vision is to rely o=

Enron's trading expertise while trying to

I=20
spoke recently with Jim Fallon, the current
head trader in EBS, and we put together a short list of topics of interest=
=20
where you might be able to help educate us.
I put these in the order of interest (to Mr. Fallon).

1.   Where will bandwidth prices go?   The direction of prices, obviously i=
s=20
the concern of any trader.   We realize that=20
technological innovation will continue to drive down prices, but are still=
=20
interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall, =20
if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where yo=
u=20
could see prices stable or rising for some length of time, =20
if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious=20
amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing,=20
and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect =
on=20
prices of new technologies.
 The term "bandwidth" might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity, but cou=

pricing.

2.  During the last year, Enron purchased a company known as "Warpspeed" in=

order to acquire their MetaRouter technology.   To quote from the Enron pre=
ss=20
release:

"MetaRouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the=
=20
optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in=
=20
the world. Capable of processing thousands of connections per second,=20
MetaRouter significantly enhances Enron=01,s ability to automate circuit=20
provisioning."

There may be two separate questions to ask here.   First,  in the context o=
f=20
the current market (or the market which may develop in the next 1-2 years),=
=20
will the MetaRouter be a commercially viable product?   That is,  will it=
=20
address an actual need in the market, or would it be more cost effective ju=
st=20
to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits?

The second question (our first real technical question):  is the MetaRouter=
=20
technology scalable?     Before starting on this project, Vince and I will=
=20
need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are=20
implementing this technology.

3.  Aggregation of loads.   A recurring question comes from a number of are=
as=20
such as IP, network storage, and   streaming media transport sales:  What=
=20
value can I get form aggregating customers, each of which has some type of=
=20
stochastic load profile?   Giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates t=
o=20
IP transport, but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail.   =
=20
The main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual=
=20
customer data.   I am told that in a few months we will have some more usef=
ul=20
history.   My understanding is that what will be available will be 5-minute=
=20
averages of usage, so we still will not know on a short time scale what the=
=20
distribution of load looks like.


I hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our=
=20
concerns are at this point.   Please let me know your thoughts about these=
=20
topics.   I would expect, for instance that question number 1 may not be=20
reasonable as a research project, but might be a question which you would=
=20
feel comfortable in addressing by giving us  your qualitative opinions, may=
be=20
in the form of a talk here at Enron.   =20


Again,  let me know your thoughts, and I look forward to seeing you again=
=20
soon.

Hello Vince and Stinson,

First of all,

BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together
some time to have dinner.

I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!

We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the=20
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research.

Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quart=
er,
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of=
=20
course
you could visit us before that too.


With my WARMEST WISHES,

Nick

GOOD NEWS!!!!!
I contacted Schlitterbahn about a two-day ticket for next year and they told me that it is not well advertised but if you want a second-day ticket all you have to do is go to the admissions booth, show them your ticket for the current day or arm band and you will be able to purchase the second-day ticket for:  Adult $16.62, Child $12.07.  This is the only way you can get a reduced ticket for the second day.  Get the second-day ticket as you go in because the admission booth closes at 6 pm.  That is not all the second-day ticket can be used anytime, it does not have to be used the next day.

Michelle,
Our True-Quote rep is Kelly Stroud at 713-350-1008.  If Jim wants to call
her to find out some info, he can tell her he got the number from Calpine.
I have only met Kelly Stroud a couple of times and she will remember me
because I was taking motorcycle classes when I met her and she used to ride
bikes.
Good Luck

If I were you I would take Hwy 290 to Sam Houston Tollway, take beltway to I-45, then

take I-45 North and exit Kuykendahl - turn left under freeway and when you get to

light (not  feeder light) but approx one block later there will be the light @Kuykendahl - turn

right and stay on Kuykendahl all the way - you will pass the intersection at FM1960 and

then I think at the next light  or one after that is "WOERNER RD"  TURN RIGHT AND APPROX

1/2 BLOCK down you'll see sign on left "Shirley Acres" - its in the trees.....thats the place



See the red star above that is "Woerner Rd" and see where you exit off I-45 on Rankin/Kuykendalh exit,

go left under freeway and then turn right onKuykendahl....  You can come all the way down 1960 from Hwy 249

but thats a long slow trip with a lot of lights and traffic.....

Pray for sunshine and warm weather....

Caio bene'

This is funny - I've been thinking about you too!  We went to Zio's
yesterday - met Kenna there.  I had not been there since you guys.  It was
good to see her.  I had lunch with Randa the other day too - miss watching
you two communicate - ha!
What's going on with you?  You like your job?
I finally bought a Kenny Chesney CD and that song "hello", I remember with
you how I did not want to like that song .... but I love it and him.  I'm a
little slow to come around sometime - ha!
Are you still shopping?  How's Meghan?  I bet she's talking!!!
Update me when you can!

Nick,

Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays
and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford.
I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Let's
plan to meet for dinner then.

I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research  
project.
We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project
and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it.
It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection
of the research topics.

We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns.
Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall 
welcome him with open arms.

I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the 
arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.

Vince

Hello Vince and Stinson,

First of all,

BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together
some time to have dinner.

I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!

We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the 
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research.

Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter,
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of 
course
you could visit us before that too.


With my WARMEST WISHES,

Nick

I would like to invite you to participate in a conference on "Retail
Participation in Competitive Power Markets" to be held at Stanford
University on June 21-22, 2001. Although California and other regional
markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June,
there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to
transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from
different experiences.

This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for
understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and
to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend
directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come
from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more
information about the conference by checking under "Meetings" on our EMF
website listed below.

Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to
make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and
describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will
cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers
should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand
response programs rather than on the technical details of their
methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their
experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected
issues.

Thank you,
Hill Huntington

not one here yet.? Also, remind me when I'm there to bring you the Urban

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference.  I would
like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.

As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing
power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it
seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the
"forgotten resource" in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a
lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many
researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was
asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give
it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by
policymakers.

Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a
useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major
sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron
that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate,
it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the
conference is widely circulated among key government groups.

I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and
recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to
participate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of
providing funding for this effort.

Thank you,

That is so rad Bill. I'm pretty jealous, but at least one of us will get to enjoy this amazing day! What happened to the drive up to St Helens on your motorcycle?? I think that sounds like a rad time. Maybe you will take me up there one day during the summer when the sun is shining?? That would totally rule. I would be so into that. Anyhow, have a great time playing golf. Try to shoot a birdie for me. hee heeMessage-ID: <25723346.1075854184207.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

I will be taking a sabbatical beginning any moment.  I have no control over 
the exact time; it may have already happened.  I plan to visit the mountains 
and the ocean.  They miss me. I miss them.  

Unfortunately, Enron requires employees to use vacation time instead of Inner 
Self time, so I will have to return someday.  Looks like July 5th.  I'm kind 
of bummed about it, but maybe by then I will have transcended to a new 
plateau of understanding.

In my absence, contact Milind Patil, x39247 for Unify performance issues.

Thanks for understanding,

All:
From Matt's response it sounds like you might want to specify exception personnel for 8-12, 12 thru 4:00, and 4 thru 6 Normal business hours and not end of the month, holidays or long weekends.

yes, you are correct.  when we watchdog, we'll most likely do VM and Settlements and not PM.  But, in the afternoon, if they need payments out the door, PM will get it.  It goes both ways.  So, if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what, that would help.  

you are correct, 8-12 is logistics critical, and after that it's anyones guess.

Based on Victor's response, I think there is some confusion.  There are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day.  Perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog.  I interpreted it to mean the 8-12 AM period but Victor was thinking the afternoon.  Depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out.

The critical users on the east desk using path manager will be Meredith Homco, Clarissa Garcia, Christina Sanchez and Victor Lamadrid. If you could alert us as to when y'all are invoking watchdog to kick logistics out, that would be great.  THANKS

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Vince,

Here are the overview Powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
relationship management firm, Azure Capital, I mentioned in my voice
mail.  The transactions they completed in their past lives at CSFB and
already in the new firm, as well as their advisory board are probably
the strongest evidence of their capabilities.

Hope all is well.

Blake

Dear Vince,

this is great news!  Donna and I are delighted that you have time to see us
on May 4th.

I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my
assistant, Carol Lovell, I will ask her to get in touch with Shirley for
scheduling as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to
meet with Christie Patrick as well.

Looking forward to meeting you,

Susan

Alan further to our discussion last Friday (your Thursday). The current 
practice remains whereby confirmations are sent Sue (to be replaced Scott) 
for signature. However, in recent times due to Sue's unavailability Heidi has 
been called upon to sign confirmations using her backup authority (on approx. 
3 occasions).

The report  arising from the recent "Project Doorstop" audit of the Sydney 
office included recommendations on development of a back office function in 
Sydney. This is under active discussion.

Vince,

   Sorry about the delay in responding.   It's the end
of the quarter and I'm teaching 3 courses, so things are
very busy, plus I had to work on a response to the FERC
Proposed Order for California.  Here is my student's CV.

Sally

Hello again, and how are you?

I guess you are still as busy as described below, but I hope you got some 
time out from your Friday concept, and have had some time to think about 
Japan. FYI, on Wednesday I will have a confrence call with Brent Price to 
talk about EGM and Japan, from a Commercial Support perspective. 

FYI, I am up in Oslo this week signing off Enron Nordic Energy, and are 
comming to San Antonio next week for this accounting offsite, where I guess I 
will see you? Any news on the offsite you were planning in October with Mike?

I look forward to hear from you.

Regards
Jan-Erland

Subject: Re: Enron Japan Commercial Support Model  

Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office 
in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought 
processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations 
personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.  
While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good 
option.  

I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After 
several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a 
practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no 
meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your 
document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a 
note then if there are any other comments that I have.  

I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while 
you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some 
concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my 
schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the 
calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he 
is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person 
sometime in the not too distant future.  

Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business 
controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a 
location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential 
dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a 
long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join 
us.

The new SITARA to UNIFY bridge monitor is in production.

The monitor shows deals in error state (failed) or in queue to bridge 
(pending) - for deals going to UNIFY from SITARA.

You will find it under - Start - Programs - Trading - SITARA - SU Bridge 
Monitor.

You may need to load the Borland BDE v5.0 software to use this, if not 
already loaded. 

We enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool.




If deal is in an error state on the SITARA side - we have not sent it over to 
UNIFY.
If the deal in an error state on the UNIFY side - SITARA has sent it to UNIFY 
- however - it is in the UNIFY failed deal group.

You can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit.

The date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal. 
Start Date and Stop Date - are begin and end date of deal.

SITARA deal ID - as well as - EOL deal ID.

Indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal.

If you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the STATUS = P 
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions 
(awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal).  If you 
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have 
access to multiple desks. 

You can hit the refresh button to re-query the data - or set the auto refresh 
on the tool bar.

We did not build Filter by Business Unit for multiple reasons:
- the expense to build the filter.
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing.
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it.
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error 
state - once Petro Can/Suncor/Sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
  number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column. 
- If you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel 
feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel.

If you have any questions or problems - please call the SITARA hotline.

Roll up for the Enron auction webcast
By John Lettice
Posted: 02/27/2002 at 03:34 EST


Seeing everybody else has been doing the Enron auction and all the shredder
jokes we weren't going to bother, but our eye couldn't help catching the
featured items in the London sale, and it all became somehow entrancing. The
shredders, BBC Radio 4 tells us this morning, have been withdrawn, but...

50 Cisco routers and switches? Who cares, 500 Compaq and Sun servers, maybe
more interesting, and 4,000 15 and 18in flat panel displays. Yum. We can't
be bothered digging into the catalogue to see if the 2,000 workstations are
proper ones or just more Compaqs, but then the list gets seriously weird.

"Fully equipped Techno Gym... Contents of Cafe and 12 Pitstops... [Pitstops?
Wassat?]... Contents of laundy [eeugh]... 15 Meeting Rooms 6-40 people
[people? They're auctioning people?] ... 50 Modern Artworks."

Hurry hurry folks, it commences at 10am GMT today through Friday, and if you
can't get yourself to London, SW1, you'll find details of the webcast here.

Not too bad so far - of course, first day is kind of boring, and not a lot of 
people in the office.? We get out at noon tomorrow and are off Monday and 
Tuesday.

I am not sure when we will be back - you can mail the pics if you want to, or 
wait.? I have some also, but the Christmas ones are on a new roll that is not 
finished yet.? I am guessing we will either be in Houston or Dallas at New 
Year's.? 

Should I use Michelle.Lokay@enron.com for your address, or is mlokay okay? 
(it rhymes!)? Also, what is Scott Goodell's e-mail - it came back to me?

Hope to see you soon, and have a great Christmas.? Oh yeah, would you be 
interested in the pedicure I have left on my Urban Retreat gift certificate?? 
I never got around to using it.

Hey there Bill!

I thought I'd drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself.
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit
Portland in July.  I do have a college friend out there (who I hope to
locate) so you might not have to be stuck with me. :)

Anyhow I'm Nikki.  I'd go more into depth but everytime I write it out it
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction!

Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  I
can't wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just
to say "hi".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in
my building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to know
people.

I don't know what Brendan has told you about me but here's the story.  I was
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies
me back home I look around and agree.

So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've never
visited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it's
because of the two movies "Goonies" and "Kindergarten Cop".  I loved those
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's my
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I
go after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll see
which fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the
"best" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the life
experience to kick in and lead the way later.

As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.
I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really "do" planning and
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's better
that way.  Life can be too organized!

Well now that I've given you a "short" introduction...haha.  I'd love to
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.
Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I am
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't go
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible
while I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)

Hope to hear from you soon!
Nikki

Hi Vince,

Unfortunately, I have not heard from him.  He also forwarded his resume to

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

Best regards,

I'm not sure if this  spreadsheet will work for you.  I don't remember the exact data you wanted,  so I did things from memory.  The dates may not be correct, because I  (multiplied the number of months * 30 days) then added this number to the start  date to project the ending period.  You know our our SAP software  automatically does things like this :)

Thanks to the teamwork and dedication of the Transwestern Commercial team, we're well positioned to meet or exceed our 2001 goals.  While all of our employees have contributed to the success of TW's first six months of 2001, several individuals have made significant commercial contributions:

Lorraine, Michelle, and Jeff have successfully negotiated the Red Rock Expansion contracts within a record one month's time.  The value of these transactions is expected to have a positive impact on our revenue starting next year and into the future.

TK has negotiated creative interruptible transport deals at the California border, sold significant Park N' Ride volumes and negotiated several short-term index deals with a sharing mechanism that have had a strong impact on our bottom line.
 
Jeff  has also structured several long-term index-to-index deals and developed a hedging strategy to lock-in market rates.    

Thank you for your hard work and innovation.  It demonstrates your commitment to excellence and to our Company.


Stan

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, "What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Subject: Prelminary Findings on Deals Not Bridging

I've attached a spreadsheet showing deals that were not bridged to Unify for 
November.  Please don't let this alarm you, this is how the bridge has always 
worked.  If you have questions or would like to discuss, please let me know.

Every instance I've found looks okay because of the following:

* A Transport Ut ticket on the same pipe was the deal
* The deal was killed
* The deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the 
Inactive state in Unify
* The deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes
* The deal didn't have a point assigned to it, only a zone

Thanks

Stinson,

I'm arriving at the George Bush airport in Houston next Thursday at 5:15pm.
I could then take a taxi to the hotel or the restaurant. How long would it
take me to get there? Is there a "rush hour" problem at that time?

> Also, if you are

I'm flying out of Houston on Friday at 6:45pm. Is there a rush hour problem
on the freeways at that time? What time should I leave from Enron to be at the
airport at 6pm?

I hope I'll have opportunities to give talks at Enron in subsequent visits
along the research path. In this first visit I was hoping to understand better
the research goals of Enron and brainstorm with people about what are the
top challenges and opportunities for our research collaboration. Identifying
the best research problems in terms of
1) highest innovation potential and
2) highest projected impact
would be at the top of my list. It might be unprofessional on my side to
talk to an audience that I don't have any prior information about and is
very diverse anyway; it could actually be "dangerous." I would feel MUCH more
comfortable to do that in my second visit, after I have understood the 
environment
better and I have some results to talk about. I would like to be in a
position to "impress" people when I give my first talk at Enron. (Besides,
I will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and I am totally swamped
all next week.)

I'm swamped, but I'll try to put something together.

I look forward to seeing you next week.

Eyes of Texas

A cowpoke in West Texas was herding cattle one day when he heard faint
music coming from nearby. After hunting about for a time, he discovered
the sound was loudest near one particular calf, and was even louder near
the calf's tail. Putting his head close to the calf's hind end, he heard
"The eyes of Texas are upon you, all the live long day..."

Amazed, he tossed the calf over his horse's back, mounted and rode
quickly to his line shack 10 miles away. There he put the calf into his
truck and drove 74 miles to Ft. Stockton, where he took the animal to a
vet.  When the vet asked him what was going on, the cowpoke told him,
and the vet went around behind the calf and gave a listen, too. He
agreed he heard "The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away..."
but didn't seem particularly excited.

"Man, how can you stand there and not be amazed?" the cowpoke asked.

The vet, a third generation Aggie, said, "Bud, I'm an Aggie, and I've
been listening to assholes sing the "Eyes of Texas" for years.

Subject:	Visit from Stanford?


Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations
for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.

I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with
Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip
to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the
university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to
include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,
May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip
planning.

The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities
in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact.

I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,

Sincerely,
Susan Hansen

Hi Shirley,

thanks for corresponding with Carol during my absence, and confirming our
meeting with Vince Kaminski at 1:30 on May 4th.  I have a question about
the logistics.  I believe Dr. Kaminski has received an invitation to an
event in Houston: new Stanford president John Hennessy is visiting a number
of cities on a "welcome tour," and it just so happens he is hosting a
luncheon in Houston on May 4th.  If Dr. Kaminski wants to attend the
Hennessy Welcome Tour luncheon, Donna Lawrence and I could meet with him at
1:30 somewhere in the hotel.  If he's not attending the presidential event,
please let me know where you are located, and we'll plan travel time
accordingly.

Regards,
Susan

Because of unique aspects of their language and culture, the Japanese 
generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers.  
In some Japanese, this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and 
behaviors.

The Japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individual's public 
and private faces, so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views 
of foreigners.  Nevertheless, every now and then, a politician's remarks will 
land him in trouble. 

You might find the enclosed article interesting.  By the way, Ishihara spent 
two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the 
past couple of days.

Regards,



Eugenio


      Ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate 

                Yomiuri Shimbun

                Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara late Wednesday acknowledged in a 
statement
                that it was "inappropriate" for him to have used the word 
"sangokujin" and
                said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and 
hurting foreigners in
                general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech. 

                It was the first time that Ishihara had clearly admitted to 
having hurt foreign
                residents by using the word, which has discriminatory 
connotations.
                "Sangokujin" literally means "people from third countries." 
Yet it was used
                after World War II as a derisory term for people from former 
Japanese
                colonies, primarily Koreans, living in Japan. 

                On April 9, he told members of the Ground Self-Defense Forces 
in Tokyo
                at a ceremony, "Atrocious crimes have been committed 
repeatedly by
                sangokujin and (other) foreigners who have illegally entered 
Japan. It is to
                be expected that they will riot in the event of a major 
disaster." 

                Although he used the word to refer to those who have 
illegally entered the
                country, it had a different meaning from what he meant to 
say, he said. 

                "I did not intend to hurt Korean or other foreign residents 
in Japan, and I am
                extremely regretful," Ishihara said in the statement, 
promising that he would
                never again use the "inappropriate word," which is prone to 
cause
                misunderstanding. 

                On April 14, he expressed regret over his remarks, but 
stopped short of
                acknowledging the derogatory import of the word "sangokujin" 
and failed to
                apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners. 

                Wednesday's statement was made in response to demands from
                metropolitan assembly members of Minshuto (Democratic Party 
of Japan)
                asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology. 

                Ishihara handed the statement to senior Minshuto members of 
the assembly
                after they held a meeting earlier in the day. 

                The statement, to which Ishihara will affix the governor's 
official seal, will
                become an official document. 

                Hidejiro Kawai, secretary general of the Minshuto group 
within the
                assembly, said, "An official document carries weight, which 
will be
                tantamount to the governor's withdrawal of his remarks and 
apology,"
                indicating that the group will not take the matter further.

Darrell,

Grant Masson, Ronnie Chahal and myself made a contribution to the book
on energy derivatives to be published soon in Australia (a book by
Clewlow and Strickland).

Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is 
less
than satisfactory. I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and
embarrassing  errors in what we submit. I would appreciate if you could 
take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same
arrangement as in the previous cases).

Thanks for looking at our storage model. I shall give you a call within the
next few days to update you on our work and developments at Enron.
Vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks. He wants to graduate and look
for work: he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes
no economic sense. He spent the summer building his
own computer (1000 MHz clock speed). I was the unskilled immigrant worker
toiling under his management.

I hope everything is well at home and that your wife's company is doing great.

Regards.

Vince

The next global city?
The blob that ate east Texas
Jun 21st 2001
HOUSTON
From The Economist print edition (June 23, 2001)

For most outsiders, Texas is a foreign country. Its biggest city, though,
might surprise the rest of the world

WHEN a Texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is, reach
for the salt. Bob Lanier, the former mayor of Houston, isn't actually
wearing a Stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls
25 miles away in every direction. But metaphorically he is. Houston, he
claims, could become one of the great cities of the world.  The remarkable
thing is that he might be right.

From the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970s, Houston doubled
in size almost every decade.  Then, despite one of the deepest slumps any
city had experienced since the 1930s, the metropolitan area managed to add
1m people in the 1990s to grow to 4.7m, making Houston the fourth-largest
city in America.  It is already bigger than Berlin and, with a GDP of around
$215 billion a year, has a larger economy than Hong Kong. Because it is the
nearest metropolis to the cities of northern Mexico, it may attract another
2m people over the next two decades, which would give it almost the same
size of population as London has now.  But a global city? These are few and
far between.  Houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre
like London, New York or Tokyo. But its business leaders think it could
become a cosmopolitan, entrepreneurial hub, a Hong Kong, a San Francisco or
even a new Los Angeles. It shares LA's smog, its sprawl, its Latino culture,
even its ugly hubris; and by some measures it surpasses LA's ability to
reinvent its economy. Can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a
properly international place?

Oil be there for you

Its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry.
Energy accounts for half of Houston's economy. During the 1970s, while the
rest of America stagflated, Houston boomed as high oil prices sucked
billions into the country's oil capital. In that decade alone, the city
built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial
property available in San Francisco. Money was being lent and business plans
formed on the assumption that oil would go to $50 a barrel. At the height of
the boom, about 80% of the city's economy was oil-related.  The bust was
traumatic. By the mid-1980s, all that new office space stood empty. Every
big local bank was taken over. Only one of the property developers then in
business is left.

Unsurprisingly, a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil
business.  The Greater Houston Partnership, the main business lobby, has
spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify. Yet
the fact is that the energy business and Houston itself have emerged
stronger from the terrible bust.  As company after company was forced to cut
back, they collapsed their operations back into Houston and seem unlikely to
be dispersed again. In 1999, when oil slumped to $10 a barrel and the number
of oil rigs in America fell to its lowest point in living memory, Houston
still managed to add energy jobs.  Now another boom is in prospect, with oil
prices high again. Matt Simmonds, the head of a local energy consultancy,
argues that America's past reluctance to build new power plants will force
it to increase energy capacity by around 30% in the next ten or 15 years.
The rig count is already 50% above last year, and natural gas exploration is
soaring. If oil prices stay high (a big if) and if other countries share
America's energy worries, Houston will grow in importance.

It is hampered by a wild-catting reputation. In fact, the energy business is
changing in three significant ways, and Houston is the centre of all of
them.  First, technology. Not long ago, oil drills went down to 1,500 feet
(457 metres). Now they go to 15,000 feet. Companies use four-dimensional
computer imaging to plan new fields (time is the fourth). This is making oil
an information-intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills
available in Houston.  Second, the cost of new oilfield exploration and
development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always
finance them alone. This makes deal-making vital, which is good for the city
where deals are made. If you are not attending, say, lunch at Houston's
Petroleum Club, you are out of the loop.  Third and most important, oil is
now only part of a bigger energy business, which includes electricity. Once
divided into self-contained regional markets run by local utilities, the
electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national
grid dominated by power producers and traders. Big users now decide whether
to buy power at long- or short-term rates, rather as they arrange their
financing. A new business of energy arbitraging is emerging, and itscentre
is Houston.

Three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main
tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago. One of them,
Enron, is building a 50,000-square-foot trading floor?? single-company
answer to the Chicago Board of Trade.  Enron has probably been Houston's
most successful energy company of the past ten years. It has never explored
for, pumped up, or refined a single drop ofoil. Out of the black stuff

However well-placed Houston is to take advantage of the energy business, it
will never be a great city as a one-trick pony. Its boosters point to other
strengths:

*Trade. Houston is America'ssecond largest port, which is remarkable
considering it is 50 miles from the sea.

*Computers. The city is home to Compaq, America's third-largest PC maker. If
you include Dell, based in Austin, two of America?? four big computer firms
are in south-east Texas, not Silicon Valley.

*Space. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration centre is in
Houston, thanks to LyndonJohnson, a native son.

*Medicine. Houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the
world. In a moment of extraordinary optimism, the city set aside 700 acres
in the middle of town for medicine. The hospitals, clinics and research
centres of the Texas Medical Centre employ 55,000 people and deal with
70,000 patients a day. St Luke's has performed more heart surgery than any
other hospital in the world. MD Anderson and the Texas Children's Hospital
are among the top two in their respective specialities, cancerand
paediatrics.

This list has holes in it. Houston has no real financial services (the
mainstay of the biggest global cities) or pharmaceuticals (despite the
medical centre). And some of its new industries are less robust than the
boosters claim. Its port's success depends on the vagaries of Mexico's
economy. Space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the
far-off day when the commercialisation of space arrives. The Texas Medical
Centre is set up on a not-for-profit basis, so it has not been able to
commercialise its activities (hence the lack of drug firms), though a new
biotechnology park may help.  In fact, Houston's main hope for diversifying
lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible: its
stunning ability to create new firms.  For the past three years, Houston has
created more new companies than any city in America. It is almost certainly
the best place either to start a business or find a first-time job. The
reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success. The beauty
of entrepreneurialism

The first is unmeasurable, a no-holds-barred optimism of the old school. One
survey shows that about two-thirds of Americans agree with the assertion
that if you work hard in this city, eventually you will succeed.  But
Houston's figure even at the bottom of the city's recession was 75%, and now
it is 88%, the highest-ever, and (says the survey's author, Stephen
Klineberg of Rice University) the highest of any bigAmerican city.

It may not be true that anything is possible in Houston, but people act as
if it were. Bill Gilmer, the chief economist of the Houston branch of the
Federal Reserve system, argues that this explains why Houston recovered so
fast from the oil bust: unemployed engineers went out and set up their own
firms, just as aerospace engineers did in Los Angeles when the end of the
cold war put them out of business.  The second advantage is technical.
Uniquely for an American metropolis, Houston has no citywide zoning
ordinances. When planning decisions are made, they are made by developers on
their own land. For the would-be entrepreneur, it is thus easier and cheaper
to find a place to set up shop in Houston than in any other city in America.

Lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new
developments be large to capture economies of scale. They expand in leapfrog
fashion, ignoring small 20-acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast
planned towns further out. This drives land prices sharply down, especially
the further you go from the centre. On top of that, an aversion to red tape
makes it easy to get building permits. Barton Smith, a land economist at the
University of Houston, reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to
keep costs low as lack of zoning laws.

Lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of
usage (residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere) and
racially. Because there are no zoning laws to force, say, a bankrupt
restaurant to re-open as a restaurant, areas change shape quickly. At the
same time, Houston is less segregated racially than any other city, bymost
measures.

One should not be over-impressed by this. Whites in Houston may be more
likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of
a different race in the previous week, but that hasn't stopped them heading
for the suburbs. Much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks, Latinos
and Asians (the city has America's second-largest Vietnamese settlement
after southern California). But because zoning laws do not enable local
groups to keep poor people out (for example, by requiring that all housing
plots be huge), Houston remains racially desegregated by American standards.
This helps draw in immigrant workers, creating a pool of labour.

That leads to the third of Houston's main characteristics which should prove
an advantage in the 21st century: racial tolerance. Houston looked like a
southern town until the 1970s: white, with a large black minority. A
generation later, its population is roughly one-third white, one-third black
and (slightly over) one-third brown. Other cities have similar profiles but
none went from a bi-racial to amulti-racial city quite so abruptly.

Even more strikingly, it did so peacefully. Houston has not had a race riot
since 1914. For the largest southern city to have gone through the
civil-rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment
on its politics. Minorities have long been fully or over-represented in the
city council, county commissions and the Texas state legislature.  Bob Stein
of Rice University argues that, unlike other growing cities, Houston is
reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic-minded business
leaders, the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city.
Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, is an example. He has been the driving force
behind the building of two sports stadiums, and has a pet project to boost
child literacy. Rumour has it that he may run for mayor.  The effect of this
sort of civic-minded activism showed up in the late 1990s. At a time when
America was busily abolishing affirmative-action programmes, Houston went
the other way: it had a new one approved in a city-wide referendum. For
better or worse, this showed how racially tolerant it is. For how much
longer?

In many ways, Houston is thriving because it has kept alive an
old-fashioned, industrial mode of growth, built on cheap land, low taxes,
immigrant labour and unfettered pro-business policies. This model may not be
enough in the next decades.

Houston is ugly. It was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down
many of its old buildings. It may have to pull down even more after recent
floods caused $2 billion-worth of damage. It is also, as Al Gore rudely
pointed out during the presidential campaign, polluted. Since cities now
have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits, this is a big
problem, and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing.

Business leaders are frantically trying to catch up. In an unusual example
of bipartisanship, a fervently conservative property developer has joined
forces with a former member of the Clinton administration to back a $500m
bond issue to plant 1m trees. The Greater Houston Partnership has executed
an about-turn on pollution. Having argued last year that new pollution
controls damage growth, it is now on a crash course to cut ozone-creating
emissions as fast as it can.  If this sudden change of mind is real, it
poses a tough question about zoning. Houston has 2,300 people an acre,
compared with 6,000 in Los Angeles and 20,000 in New York (at the other end
of the scale). This extraordinary extensiveness is expensive. At one point
in the early 1990s, Houston alone was spending more on roads than any state
except California (and, of course, Texas).

There are doubts about how much further sprawl can go. Three-quarters of the
best-paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road. Some new suburbs
are 50 miles away. Can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting
the skilled people whose jobs are downtown? And surely that means
introducing zoning?  Lastly, Houston faces a severe problem in the one area
where its national reputation is high: education. To run his number-one
priority, Mr Bush picked as secretary of education Rod Paige, a former head
of the Houston independent school district. The president claimed,
correctly, that Mr Paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city's
education, especially among minorities. What he did not say is that these
improvements have been nothing like enough.  Despite successes in individual
schools, half of all Latinos fail to graduate from high school, compared
with 10% of whites and 20% of blacks. Whites are abandoning Houston's public
schools. They represent only 12% of pupils; 54% are Latino. More than a
quarter of today's schoolchildren are likely to dropout.

In a world where a good job depends on having a college degree, this is
alarming. Rice University's Mr Klineberg argues that new immigrants from
Mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally
than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900s. The first wave took
several generations to catch up. Today's immigrants will have to close a
bigger gap more quickly. If they do not, they may end up in an underclass
that could scratch at Houston'sracial harmony.

This is Houston

Can Houston make it? The city has experienced the three big transformations
that affect America in their purest form: the change from a raw-material
economy to services; the change from a bi-racial to a multi-racial place;
and the moderation of a no-holds-barred pro-business culture to take account
of environmental and social costs. Elsewhere, these changes have occurred
over 50 years. Houston has lived through them in 20. And the next 20 years
will probably be just as dramatic and successful. Hold onto those Stetsons.

Darrell,

I am sending you 2 technical notes on Enron default swaps: I hope that they 
will
be useful. I shall read the articles on weekend. I am curious if you
find these explanations satisfactory.

We are very slow in preparing a number of technical documents
for you for model reviews. We still hope you will be able
to find some time to review our credit models (for our London
credit trading) and  VaR and option pricing related models.

Also, please check your invoices. I still think we owe you money.


Vince

Vince: According to a Bank of America

Any idea of what is going on here?

I guess I heard some 'news' today. I spoke with Fernley and Cassandra.

We will no doubt speak next week when you're over.

I will tallk to Jo tonight.

My initial thoughts were 'wow'. I guess I need to digest the situation.

I must say a really big thank-you for the massive part you have obviously 
played in getting the opportunity this far. 

I think I'll need a beer tonight. My stomach has been knotted all afternoon.

Directions -

Go West on 26 to Murry Rd. Exit.
Take Murry to Walker Road and take a right.
The campus will be on your left.
Take a left at the first light (I think)
There will be an entrance with a waterfall along the side.
At the security bunker go right.
You will come up on a huge building on your left this is Mia Hamm building.
Park where ever you can find a spot.  There is a parking structure that
usually is a good spot to check.
Come into the Mia Hamm building and have the receptionist give me a call.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
Thanks,

Texas A&M football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown powdery substance on the
practice field. Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while
the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the
FBI determined that thewhite substance unknown to the players was actually
the goal line.  Practice resumed when the FBI agents decided that the team
was not likely to encounter the substance again.

Hi Vince,

I am on the technical program committee of the Infocom 2001 conference,
and we are meeting in New York City on Saturday, October 14th, to select
papers for the conference program. I'm leaving Stanford on Friday and
getting back on Sunday.

It might be a possibility to have dinner together on Sunday, if that would
work for you. In that case I would have to reschedule my flight to land
in SFO earlier than I'm currently scheduled to land.

Would dinner on Sunday work for you? Any chance we can meet Monday for
lunch?

I look forward to seeing you.

Best Regards,

Nick

A man asked his wife what she'd like for her birthday.   

"I'd love to be six again," she replied. 

On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off 
they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every 
ride in the park:  the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear- 
everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the 
theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a 
McDonald's they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along 
with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a 
movie - the latest Star Wars! 

What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband 
and collapsed into bed. 

He leaned over and lovingly asked, "Well, dear; what was it like being 
six again?"   

One eye opened, "You idiot, I meant my dress size." 

The moral of this story is:  If a woman speaks and a man is there to 
hear her, he will get it wrong anyway.Message-ID: <4387532.1075855003711.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

A primer on how to succeed in business:

Capitalism

You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.  Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.


Enron Capitalism

You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed
company, using letters of credit  opened by your brother-in-law at
the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated  general
offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for
five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by your CFO
who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on
six more.

The following short quiz consists of 4 questions and will tell you
whether you are qualified to be a "professional."

Scroll down for each answer. The questions are NOT that difficult and
this won't take long at all.

1.     How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
The correct answer is:  Open the refrigerator put in the giraffe and
close the door.

This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an overly
complicated way.

2.     How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
Wrong Answer:  Open the refrigerator put in the elephant and close the
refrigerator.

Correct Answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the
elephant and close the door.

This tests your ability to think through the repercussions of your
previous actions.


3.     The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals
attend except one. Which animal does not attend?
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
Correct Answer:  The Elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator.

This tests your memory.  OK, even if you did not answer the first three
questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your true
abilities.

4.  There is a river you must cross. But it is inhabited by crocodiles.
How do you manage it?
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
Correct Answer: You swim across. All the crocodiles are attending the
Animal Meeting.

This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.

According to Anderson Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the
professionals they tested got all questions wrong. But many preschoolers
got several correct answers.

Anderson Consulting says this conclusively disproves the theory that
most professionals have the brains of a four year old. Send this out to
frustrate all of your smart friends.

***PLAYBOY SEEKING "WOMEN OF ENRON" FOR PICTORIAL LAYOUT
   Saying its goal is to give Enron's female employees an opportunity that
could "lead them down a new career path," Playboy magazine has launched a
national campaign seeking women willing to shed their clothing for an upcoming
pictorial layout entitled "Women of Enron."
   "When one door closes, another one opens," said Playboy's photo director
Gary Cole, referring to the collapse of Enron and along with it, most of its
employee's savings.
   And so far the response has been phenomenal according to the Playboy
spokesperson.
   "We've put the press release out five hours ago and the amount of
interested women is substantial," Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeh Norris told
OPIS. "We have no limit on how many Enron women we'll use in the layout."
   Norris added that Playboy hopes to have issue out as soon as possible and
is pushing for a summer release.
   To be eligible candidates must be at least 18 years of age and be able to
document their employment at Enron, along with a valid birth certificate and
photo ID. A recent photo in a two-piece swimsuit and a head-and-shoulders
portrait is also required.
   For additional information, call 312-373-2758.

Thanks for the story!  Have an all day meeting today, and my grandparents are going back to Maryland.  I did get a pair of pj's for Meaghan at Gymboree - the red ones with the little pique heart design.  Hope you did not get them too!

A man asked his wife what she'd like for her birthday. 

"I'd love to be six again," she replied. 

On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off 
they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every 
ride in the park:  the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear- 
everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the 
theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a 
McDonald's they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along 
with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a 
movie - the latest Star Wars! 

What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband 
and collapsed into bed. 

He leaned over and lovingly asked, "Well, dear; what was it like being 
six again?" 

One eye opened, "You idiot, I meant my dress size." 

The moral of this story is:  If a woman speaks and a man is there to 
hear her, he will get it wrong anyway. Message-ID: <26697773.1075855002407.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Subject:	RE: EWS Tax Department Update

Good report - these are all the deals under the Americas which I know nothing about - what are they?
Thanks
Louise

Panama Trading Office - Had discussions with the Transaction Support group and PWC-Panama regarding Panamanian tax return.
		Enron of the Americas is the 100 percent shareholder of a Panamanian trading subsidiary called Enron Capital & Trade Global Resources Corp.  ("ECTGR").  Essentially, by transacting through this company and keeping income invested off-shore, Enron is able to avoid payment of taxes on trading income generated by ECTGR.  This result, however, requires that ECTGR trade in Panama in a manner that is not taxable (essentially, ECTGR must trade products that are delivered outside of Panama or within Panama inside a free-trade zone).  The Panamanian government has requested that we establish that ECTGR's trading income is derived from qualified activity and the EWS Tax Group is, in turn, working with Transaction Support (which books ECTGR's trades under a Services Agreement) and PWC (which files the Panamanian return for us) to properly document things for the government.  We are confident that our position with regard to ECTGR will be agreed with. 
Project Atlas Tube ("Atlas") - Met with origination team and EWS Reporting and Analysis Tax group to discuss initial deal structure and related tax consequences.  Atlas consists of an inventory management strategy whereby an Enron special purpose vehicle will both buy hot rolled coil steel from and resell the same to Atlas Tube, Inc. on a just-in-time inventory basis.
		This is a very interesting deal but was misplaced in the report - it should be listed under Enron Industrial Markets.  It is similar to the "Huntco transaction" and I would be delighted to send you a transaction chart if it would be of interest.  Let me know.  
Project Desperado (Velocity III) - Met with Enron Corp. tax and deal team regarding Velocity III transaction and structure.  Reviewed and revised transaction agreements and discussed such with Enron Corp. tax and deal team.
		This transaction involved the sale of various equity investments that had been made by Enron of the Americas in various companies (most significantly, Catalytica, Advanced Mobile Power Systems and Hanover Compressor) to Whitewing Associates, LP.  A total of approximately $205 million was raised in connection with the sale and resulted in positive funds flow for accounting purposes.  Whitewing LP is a deconsolidated entity in which Enron possesses an approximate 98 percent economic interest (deconsolidation is achieved, as it has been explained to me, by virtue of Enron sharing voting control with an unrelated person - the Osprey Trust which, in turn, is essentially John Hancock).  The sale of these investments, from a tax perspective, resulted in a slight tax gain (approximately, $61 million) that had been previously reserved for for financial reporting purposes.
Project Hartwell and Project Athens Energy Centers - Advised regarding state income, franchise, sales and use taxes relating to construction of power plants in Clark and Hunt Counties in Georgia.  Plants to be sold prior to commercial operation.
		Enron of the Americas is developing two plants (described as "Simple Power Plants") in Georgia with the intent of selling the plants before they become operational.  EWS Tax analyzed the various state and local taxes applicable to the construction of the plants, inputs (i.e., natural gas) to the plants during operations and income resulting from operations.  Georgia imposes a sales tax on components used to construct the plants (granting, as well, however, an exemption from such taxes if appropriate tax certificates are acquired), provides a state tax exemption on the purchase of natural gas if it is used to generate electricity (but, otherwise, the local government charges a 3 percent tax on such natural gas) and, finally, taxes income earned by the company generating the electricity (at 6 percent on U.S. federal adjusted net income).
Utiliquest Transaction - Met with deal team to discuss disposition of ENA's 74% interest in Utiliquest LLC.  Reviewed unit purchase agreement and met with outside counsel to other unit holders to discuss tax structuring and benefits of using synthetic 338(h)(10) structure.
		Utiliquest is an investment in a utility locating company that the Principal Investment Group of Enron of the Americas is selling.  EWS Tax helped develop the structure by which the purchaser of the investment will be able to push their purchase price paid for the stock in Utiliquest to the assets of Utiliquest (essentially, this improves the purchaser's after-tax yield (through increased depreciation) without detriment to Enron).

Thanks for your suggestions.  I forgot about you leaving at 4:30.  By girls
have both those movies.  At age 2, my girls could not sit down long enough
to watch a movie.  They would watch a few minutes at a time of Barney.

Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr
was a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't
expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would
recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she
watches every night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls
seen either one?

Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven't
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I've seen "Perfect
Storm" and "The Patriot" .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.

Stanford Team, 

We have received yet another acceptance - Noah Jacobs has accepted our offer as a summer associate.  We are now 4 of 6 for our summer offers.  I have sent Paul Kasper, our one full time offer a cultivation gift and will be checking in on him next week.  Also Eric Cope, a Stanford student that Vince Kaminski's group had interviewed here in Houston for a summer associate position has also accepted.  All in all our Stanford numbers are looking great!

Many thanks to everyone and keep up the great work!

Hi Stinson,

Eventually, the team here (Giuseppe, Eric, myself) has converged to two
possible dates to propose for a visit:

1) Friday, March 2
2) Friday, March 9

How do these look on your side?

We'll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.

I look forward to seeing you again.

Best,

Subject: Visit to Enron



Hello Vince,

It was nice seeing you at Stanford and many thanks for the lunch
we had together. I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the
technical level and otherwise.

I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for
a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was
clearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule -
mine is rather terrible:

Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter
Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron
to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to
visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in
Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.

Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably
is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this
research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be
important for the student support funds to be in place then, so
that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top
talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have
approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing "soft
commitments to star-level students" to get this research and its
potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought
after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this
competition.

Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the
project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the
end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can
happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.
I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets
going. Please let me know what you think.

Best Regards,

Nick

I hope this email finds all of you high and dry.  However, many people were not as fortunate.  

Community Affairs is taking a count of Enron employees that were displaced or affected by the flood.  Please email me or call me at x33597 if you were affected.  

If you want to make a monetary donation to the Red Cross or any other agency, I am pleased to report that the Enron matching gift program has been expanded to match your donation.  

Enron is looking into other avenues to assist the victims but, we need to hear from you first.  Please email me or call me if you or a fellow employee has been affected.  

Enron will be making determinations based on this information and how to proceed and assist the victims.  

I can be reached at x33597 if you have any questions.  Message-ID: <27200488.1075844090998.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

One morning Dick Cheney and George W. Bush were having brunch at a
restaurant.

The attractive waitress asks Cheney what he would like and he replies, "I'll
have a bowl of oatmeal and some fruit."

"And what can I get for you, sir?" she asks George W.

He replies, "How about a quickie?"

"Why, Mr. President," the waitress says, "How rude . . . you're starting to
act like Mr. Clinton and you haven't even been in office for a month yet!"

As the waitress storms away, Cheney leans over to Bush and whispers, "It's
pronounced "quiche."

To help avoid Unify problems during bid-week we must be keeping up with the 
business on the non-EDI pipes throughout the month rather than wait until the 
end of the month to clean-up and bridge back. The IT staff has identified 
this as one of the things Logistics could do to help them maintain reasonable 
performance. 

Please make sure you know the status of each of your pipes and speak to the 
schedulers if you see they aren't keeping their data clean and bridged. I 
expect you to keep on top of this throughout each month.

We are asking everyone else to work around our schedule so lets make sure we 
do our part.

Stinson,

How about Monday, August 21st or Monday, Aug. 28?

Mondays are especially effective, because I would like to
come on Saturday and work over the weekend together with
Giuseppe before the meetings on Monday.

Hi,  How is everyone doing?  Busy , Busy, Busy I know.

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and 
several questions have come up.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the 
Japanese  - English translation. The accounting system used will need to 
interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need 
to interface with the bank.  

  Please advise.

Thank you,

Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
change should flow smoothly.

Thanks,
m.m.

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

Japan's Electricity Newspaper ("Denki Shimbun", the equivalent of Megawatt 
Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several 
of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran 
across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I 
thought you would find it interesting.

The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by 
being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we 
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.  
The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.

The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is 
about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese 
are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.

Denki Shimbun also has a web site at "www.shimbun.denki.or.jp".  They have 
small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is 
completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is 
"www.criepi.denken.or.jp", the English home site of Japan's Central Research 
Institute of Electric Power Industry (Denryoku Chuo Kenkyuujou).  The site 
has many links to other English-language sites related to the power industry 
in Japan.

on May 4th.

I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my

scheduling as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to
meet with Christie Patrick as well.

Looking forward to meeting you,

California's new State Song! The Rolling Blackout Theme Song
(To the theme music from the TV western "Rawhide") 
Rollin', rollin', rollin',
Though the state is golden,
Keep them blackouts rollin', statewide.
A little colder weather,
And we all freeze together,
Wishin' more plants were on the line.
All the things I'm missin',
Like lights and television,
Are waiting 'til we can pay the price. 
(Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide! 
Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them rates a-movin', statewide.
Don't try to understand 'em,
Just raise, charge, and collect 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
My heart's calculatin',
Nuclear plants will be waitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride. 
(Chorus)
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide!

Stinson,

Great! I'm looking forward to a very productive collaboration.
I'll immediately start doing Giuseppe's papers, for him to work
on the Enron/Stanford program.

Many Thanks to you and Vince, and I hope to see you soon at Stanford
or Enron. If I remember correctly, Vince is visiting Stanford in
October.

Hey!  Good to hear from you.  Yes, it is sad about Randa but we are all
thinking about her and praying for her.  I hope she found a job by now - I
think she was laid off during 1Q lay offs!  Her husband is still working
her, so that is good at least one of them still has a job at least.

Meghan - I forgot her name already!  I bet she is a cutie.  I just saw my
niece in Colorado Springs - it was her 3rd birthday this past Sunday so I
got to celebrate it with her.  We had a party for her and I don't think I
saw so many 2 and 3 year olds in my life!  They kept wanting to eat
something - anything.   Are kids always that hungry?  It was hilarious.  I
can't believe she is talking in complete sentences either.  I'm shocked at
how time really flies by.  Yes, it seems just like yesterday she was born.
I think that is neat that Kellyn (my niece) and Meghan are close in age.
I'll have to be sure to remember that!

No huge vacations for us..my husband and I bought a house in Magnolia May
2000 - 1 month before I got laid off - so all our money has been going into
the house for the past year.  I bet you didn't know about it because I don't
think they gave me a chance to say goodbye to anyone when they let us go.
I'm wondering, did you even know I got laid off?  I can't remember anymore.
Its been such a long time.  Besides the Colorado trip I just took, we are
going to Connecticut next week for my husband's family reunion, so it will
be nice to be in cool weather again.  How about you guys?  Are you still the
jetsetters of Houston?

I know we probably won't see each other but Marilyn and I talk about you
once in a while and how much fun and interesting you were.  If ever you are
in the neighborhood, please give us a call and we would love to see you,
okay?  Take care.

Thanks for asking about Meghan (that's so sweet).  Can you believe she

Great to see you this week and I hope you had a safe flight home.

I'd like to talk about the RIsk person 'appointment' for Tokyo.

I guess you told me about H...Perez (sorry I forget!). How do you rate him? 
What level/grade is he? Can you let know/send me his last PRC? Joe wants to 
talk about staffing next week. I'll get a feel of the level we need/want we 
can spend etc....

I guess my 'must have' criteria would be 1) Detailed EnPower experience - in 
both ops, dev'p and daily admin 2) Excellent/Superior ranking 3) Someone you 
see as a future 'star' - as this will be (in my opinion) a great opportunity 
for someone.

I certainly can think of a few names right off the bat (depending on the 
'level' Joe will allow us) - both here and Houston - Edith (Director? - maybe 
too senior), Paul D.Arcy/Rob Yeo (2 Sen Spec in London) etc....

What do you think? Let's talk.

Dear Enron Employee,


I am a retirement plan specialist with Raymond James & Associates
(RJF-NYSE). I understand these are trying times at your company and I hope
that your are not too heavily affected by the current distressed financial
situation of your company. I once was employed by a company that filed
bankruptcy so I speak from experience and have previously been placed in
your precarious position. Being a retirement plan specialist, and having
worked with associates that have Enron clients, I want to share some
important information about your retirement plan benefits. Should you have
any questions about retirement plans your queries are more than welcome. 

I want to make you aware that you are allowed to rollover into an individual
IRA any portion of  your retirement  benefit plan which you have contributed
to as an in service distribution provided you have met Enron's vesting
requirement, which is either 2 or 5 years of participation. I would strongly
recommend that it is probably a good idea to think about doing  so with th
exception of  your Enron stock. There are other factors to consider however
like the possibilty of forfeiting loan provisions should Enron pull through
among others. Keep in mind however, that although your current asset
holdings are protected by ERISA, should the company file bankruptcy those
assets remaining in  the company sponsored plan can be frozen for an
unspecified amount of time, denying you access to your funds. 

An IRA rollover gives you more flexibility and choices of investments and
seperates the assets from company control.  If you have questions or  need
assistance in rolling over your plan assets please call me  at
1-800-523-3295  from 8-5 EST or email me at
 jsarlat@33e.rjf.com.  My personal and corporate website can be found at
www.raymondjames.com/johnsarlat  should you require more information about
my personal or companies qualifications. Please inform your co- workers
about their rights and options under the plan. Obviously time is of the
essence!  I wish you the best of luck and hope that the challenging
environment changes for the better. I have included an article at the bottom
of this page. .


Sincerely,

John Sarlat

By Andrew Kelly
    HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - A flurry of lawsuits filed against
ailing energy giant Enron Corp. ENE have highlighted
potentially devastating consequences of employee retirement plans
that lean heavily on investments in the employer's stock.
    Enron workers, whose jobs are at risk after rival Dynegy Inc.
DYN terminated a buyout plan, have lost hundreds of thousands
of dollars on Enron stock held in retirement accounts, wrecking
dreams of a comfortable retirement for some.
    Retiree advocacy groups and attorneys said the big losses
caused by the dizzying decline in Enron's share price have exposed
fatal flaws in the 20-year-old retirement accounts known as 401
(k).
    "Employees are often encouraged to put a great deal of money
in their employers' stock and the result can be disastrous," said
Karen Ferguson off the Pension Rights Center in Washington D.C.
    Seattle-based attorney Lynn Sargo, who is pursuing one of four
employee lawsuits against Enron and a similar case against
telecommunications equipment giant Lucent Technologies Inc.
LU, said the law governing 401 (k) plans must change.
    "It is clear that additional regulations need to be put in
place because Lucent and Enron are both typical examples of large
American corporations and if such a disaster can happen to them,
then you have to ask if the current laws are adequate," he said.
    The suits filed against Enron and Lucent make similar
allegations that executives failed in their fiduciary duty to
employees by encouraging them to invest in company stock even when
they knew their companies faced big problems.

    SIMILAR SCENARIOS AT ENRON AND LUCENT
    Enron and Lucent both saw their share prices fall steeply amid
similar scenarios involving a severe loss of investor confidence,
allegations of murky accounting, overoptimistic projections and
the sudden departures of top executives.
    Enron's stock fell from a high of $90 in August 2000 to 90
cents on Wednesday. Lucent's stock fell from a December 1999 high
of around $84 to a low in June 2001 of just over $5 and was
trading at $7.66 on Wednesday afternoon.
    That has been painful for people like Enron employee Roy
Rinard who were invested heavily in Enron stock.
    "I'm basically wiped out," said the 54-year-old Rinard, who
 lost over $400,000 as a result of investing all of the funds in
his 401 (k) retirement account in Enron stock.
    Rinard says he now realizes that he broke a golden rule of
investment: don't put all your eggs in one basket; spread your
risks by diversifying your holdings.
    Traditional "defined benefit" retirement plans are subject to
a 10 percent limit on investments in employer stock, but there is
no such limit for "defined contribution" plans like the 401 (k).
    U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer tried a few years ago to have the
same limit apply to 401 (k) plans, but the measure ran into
vigorous opposition from employers who wanted to retain the right
to make their matching contributions in their own stock.
    As the rules stand companies are allowed to make all of  their
matching contributions in their own stock and workers may also put
all of their own money into company stock too.
    Diversification is thwarted in many cases by regulations that
prevent employees from selling company stock before they reach a
certain age -- 50 in Enron's case.
    James Delaplane of the American Benefits Council, an employer
group, said the 401 (k) system places great responsibility for
retirement savings on individual workers.
    "There are people who think that's the greatest thing since
sliced bread and there are people who think that's the worst
thing," he said.
    Delaplane said his organization wants to preserve employers'
right to contribute company stock to employee retirement plans but
also supports efforts to educate workers so that they can make
better informed investment decisions.
    David Certner, a pensions specialist with the American
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), said there is plenty of
work to be done in that area.
    "Many employees aren't aware of basic rules of investing, nor
of the meaning of diversification. Some actually view employer
stock as a less risky investment than a mutual fund," he said.

I just wanted to touch base with you regarding trading operations in Japan.  
During the call today, it sounds like EOL in Japan may be near up and 
running.  I was wondering if we could discuss what type of plans you have for 
a mid and back office function.  I'd like to get in the loop and help set 
controls and procedures up as soon as possible.  I have a meeting with 
Jan-Erland late next week, but if there is anything that needs to be started 
before then, please let me know.

Hi Sally

  I wondered if you could help me? Attached is a specification we used 
locally for the Australian risk management positions.  Could you review and 
perhaps add any comments with a view to creating the spec for the Enron Japan 
position? Please revert asap. 

Thanks

Phil

You don't have to respond and put your job on the line!? I bought six tickets 
to Clay Walker, Saturday, Feb 17 at 1:00.? They were $12 each with a $5 
handling fee ($77 total).? Top rows, all that was left, but the coliseum is 
not nearly as big as the dome.? The coliseum is downtown, and I had to buy 
for Caroline and Meghan since they are 2.? Looking forward to it!? Talk 
later...

I noticed that they don't give you the option to purchase George Strait
tickets for March 3.

I went out on the Kilt web site and they had a couple of names for Rodeo
performers marked tentative.  Alan Jackson on 2/14 and Clay Walker on 2/15.

That's about all I found.

Nick,

Vince asked me to coordinate the planning for you August visit to Enron.   
Vince and I are free almost any date except August 14 and 15th,  but we would 
like to try and schedule your visit at a time when you could meet with other 
key EBS executives such as Kevin Hannon and perhaps Ken Rice and John 
Echols.    If you could send me a few of your preferred choices of dates, I 
will try to optimize getting you on the calendars of these individuals.   

By the way, Giuseppe is doing a great job and has already made a very good 
impression on everyone he has worked with.  It's been a real pleasure having 
him here for the summer.

Frank,

I am definitely interested in the resume. I can meet the candidate on campus 
when
I visit my son. I am planning to come to Palo Alto around Thanksgiving.

Also, Energy and Power Risk Management (an English publication)
organizes every year in Houston a POWER RISK conference (typically in May).
They ask me for recommendations regarding
speakers. Would you be interested in participating?

Vince

Vince,

  I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.

Sally

I just want to summarize/clarify our discussions so far on the Commercial=
=20
Support model for Enron Japan.=20

My background:
In Europe the Commercial Support function was divided into a Middle Office=
=20
(MO) and a Back Office (BO) part, with a European controller (Fearnley Dyso=
n)=20
responsible for both functions. For Scandinavia, the only trading office in=
=20
Europe outside of London, I was responsible for both functions, as Local=20
Office controller, reporting into Barry Pearce, who reported to Fearnley. I=
n=20
Japan I also have this Local Office Controller function, as being responsib=
le=20
for MO/BO activities in this region. The MO would consist of the trading=20
related functions: Documentation (Capture & Confirmation), Risk Management,=
=20
Settlement and Trade Accounting. The BO would consist of G&A's, Salaries &=
=20
Wages, Tax, Management reporting, Statutory reporting and VAT.=20

Back Office:
I report directly to Cassandra Scultz (VP & CAO of Enron APACHI). As much a=
s=20
possible are to be outsourced to our Sydney office (Heidi Mason, who also=
=20
reports to Cassandra), but some work has to be done in Tokyo. The reasons f=
or=20
this outsourcing decision is enclosed in the Power Point presentation=20
enclosed below. For payments we use Houston Treasury, as they are the only=
=20
ones that can exercise a payment in the banking systems.



Middle Office:

Mandate
What I have in writing is a section from Joe Hirl's Memo (Request for Japan=
=20
Power Trading Positions (DRAFT)) to Rick Buy and Greg Whalley dated April 1=
9=20
this year (please find enclosed)

Back Office Operations:  Jan Erland Bekeng in cooperation with Sally Beck=
=20
will look to establish the local risk books in Tokyo and define any=20
system     modifications necessary given the characteristics of the Japanes=
e=20
electricity market.  Enron Japan will handle trade capture      and risk=20
management while confirmations and settlements will occur in Houston under=
=20
Sally Beck=01,s supervision.  IT support and     system modification will b=
e=20
overseen by Anthony Dayao and performed in Houston.



Discussion -  Current & Future Situation
I see more commodities than Power. Metals will arrive September 25, Weather=
=20
is on the way from Sydney, and Garry Hickerson will from September 1 have a=
=20
guy here doing IRFX, Agri and maybe Equity.  We are also looking into Oil=
=20
deals, and have plans for Gas, Coal, Pulp & Paper, Credit and Emissions. Al=
so=20
EBS is on the way. I only see Metals, IRFX and Weather as active desks this=
=20
year, maybe Oil. Power will take some more time to get active, due to the=
=20
very closed market situation here right now. On the Origination side we mig=
ht=20
see some structures/cross commidity/finance deals go through. Thus we have =
a=20
mix of activites from Enron APACHI, Enron Global Markets, EBS and Enron=20
Metals. Basically everyone wants to do some business in Japan.

To coordinate all these activities we need to build the most cost efficient=
,=20
independent, segregated, automised and service minded Japanese Commercial=
=20
Support function possible. To accomplish these objectives, outsourcing to=
=20
Sydney is an alternative that has been discussed extensive lately, and is=
=20
highly recommended from our side. Labour costs in Sydney is 25% of the cost=
s=20
in Tokyo. Due to Sydney's experience and size they are ready to expand and=
=20
take on this project. They already have the segregation and independence in=
=20
place, and would give us an extra layer of segregation in the sense of bein=
g=20
an intermideary between Tokyo and Houston. Bilingual staff would be hired t=
o=20
perform Japanese services, which is widely available in Sydney. And there i=
s=20
only one hour in difference between us. Outsourcing these activities from=
=20
Japan to Australia is a growing trend, and many large corporations have don=
e=20
it this way.

There will be some time from the first trades until functions and commoditi=
es=20
are moved to Sydney. Tokyo want and needs to learn, understand all details,=
=20
automise, make routines and calibrate systems first. On the confirmation si=
de=20
our Legal department would be heavily involved in th start, compared to lat=
er=20
stages.

Proposed MO structure for Enron Japan

A) Responsibility for all Commercial Support activities in Japan to be=20
sourced to Enron Japan, under Enron Japan's CFO.

B) Outsource programmable tasks to Sydney:
 - Documentation (Capture & Confirmation)
 - Settlement
 - Trade Accounting

C) Risk Management in Tokyo.


I look forward to hear from you.

Stanford Team, 

We have received yet another acceptance - Noah Jacobs has accepted our offer 
as a summer associate.  We are now 4 of 6 for our summer offers.  I have sent 
Paul Kasper, our one full time offer a cultivation gift and will be checking 
in on him next week.  Also Eric Cope, a Stanford student that Vince 
Kaminski's group had interviewed here in Houston for a summer associate 
position has also accepted.  All in all our Stanford numbers are looking 
great!

Many thanks to everyone and keep up the great work!
Althea

Please forward this message to all members of your group and to anyone else who might benefit from this program.

Enpower IT has done an outstanding job in creating this application.  It is invaluable to me in verifying that all my deals are in Enpower correctly 
and the delivery point is balanced.  It should be very helpful to be sure that a desk, delivery point and/or region is balanced.  Please take a look 
and come by my desk for a demo if you would like.

PS - Thanks you Casey, JP, Gerald and Jason for helping me to test this application.

Rebecca

To Open:



To Run: 

1)  Enter the criteria into the filter at the top, paying close attention to whether you want Physical or Financial deals, and whether
you want to "Include Desk-to-desk" deals.  The more filter criteria you add the fast the extract will run.

2) Hit Extract




To Export:

The middle section of the application displays all the records or strips that were extracted.  This may be quickly saved to a text
file to analyze in Excel, by choosing File...Save... from the menu.


	
To Summarize and Subtotal:

The Subtotal area at the bottom of the screen, groups and subtotals the records based on the fields that are dragged 
into the gray area right below the filter (shown here in blue).  At the very bottom of the subtotal area is a GRAND TOTAL 
for all records extracted.

Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a contract for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.

Thanks, d.n.Message-ID: <3932639.1075844090972.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Hi Stinson,

I am under pressure from the Department to wrap up Giuseppe's RAship,
and I am probing to see how things are going on this matter on your
side. I'm deep in the red in terms of the deadline - way beyond it!
Would it be possible to wrap this up this week?

Many Thanks,

Nick

A walk-thru/demo of this new functionality was held today with the Logistics 
Managers and representative schedulers from each region except for Texas and 
Calgary.  The changes were well received and no revisions were requested.  
They would like to have the changes migrated to Production the evening of 
Tuesday, January 18 for use the morning of Wednesday, January 19.

Paul, could you please insure that the network folks have the Tibco install 
complete by Monday, including Terminal Server.
Scotty, Paul may need one of your folks to insure that the Tibco install 
works OK on Terminal Server (none of us have access).
Scotty, can you follow up with Calgary and Texas since they missed the demo.
 Also, what level of security is desired for the rollout - selected 
schedulers or all of Logistics?
Dave M, plan to have the last few related items in Stage by Monday to insure 
all is clean by Tuesday night. (print, filter, closed Path List, & app close 
error msg)

If you do not feel like this schedule can be met, please let me know as you 
become aware.

Stinson,

Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills. 
We might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through
the A/A program. We would have to
hire him directly.

Hi Ravi:

I had sent an email about a week back with my resume for the summer
internship. I think the address I sent it to was not correct, so I am
resending it. I will also tell the others in the group to send there resumes
to you. Thanks.

I would like to invite you to participate in a conference on "Retail
Participation in Competitive Power Markets" to be held at Stanford
University on June 21-22, 2001. Although California and other regional
markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June,
there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to
transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from
different experiences.

This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for
understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and
to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend
directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come
from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more
information about the conference by checking under "Meetings" on our EMF
website listed below.

Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to
make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and
describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will
cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers
should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand
response programs rather than on the technical details of their
methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their
experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected
issues.

Thank you,
Hill Huntington

Hi,

You probably already heard... test of the new Sybase data base release is off 
for today.  Testing will resume tomorrow, Wed 6/21 at Noon.  People should at 
least verify their security access today.  If you do not have access, please 
contact Diane Niestrath at 3-9931 or Dave McMullan at 3-9127.

Subject: Unify stress test next week with Sybase 12.0

We have done some preliminary testing of the latest version of Sybase 
(version 12).  We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and 
would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me 
showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to 
hardware and business restrictions.

The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the 
days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of 
their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for 
your staff!

The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test 
Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window, 
select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not 
work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says 
that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions 
where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for 
those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try 
to login some time Monday to insure they have access.

The test script during the time period will be:
12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports
12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing
12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in

Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very 
important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should 
pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks 
with poor system performance the better!

Thanks in advance for your help, d.n.

Hi Sally

  Thanks for the attached.  In light of your response I think I'm after 2 
things:

   1. A spec that outlines Eugenio's role, and
  
   2. A spec that could be used to hire a Japanese national to replace 
Eugenio at the end of Eugenio's assignment in Japan.

  Hope this helps. If you could revert asap I'd appreciate it.

  Thanks

  Phil

I am in London this week and have picked up your message with the 
attachment.  If you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do 
with this, then I will be glad to help you where I can.  Are you trying to 
create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in 
Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a 
position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use 
in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the 
risk books?  These three options would all require slightly different 
descriptions of the role, so it would be helpful to know how you will use 
this.  

Please let me know and I will be glad to work on this for you.

Joe -

I spoke w/Fernley Dyson,  CAO for EE and Barry's current boss, and he's 
supportive of Barry's transfer to our region to lead the 
accounting/commercial support efforts for your Tokyo office.  I also spoke 
with Barry, and he's excited as well.  I think it's a done deal.  
Scott/Michael - I told Barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discuss 
the next steps re: a more standard expat package (not the 6 month situation - 
Causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement), and plans to 
move his family to Tokyo.

The issue we need to work out is transition, and I asked Barry to discuss 
that with you directly, Joe, and I told Fernley we'd obviously be flexible 
but we'd like him sooner rather than later.  Barry indicated the guy that 
Fernley just hired that Barry was going to be reporting to is going to start 
towards the end of April.  So I bet they're going to want some overlap there, 
which puts us into end of May before Barry could really move.  I think we 
should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with 
Heidi's help and with Carol from Houston if necessary, plus I told Barry we'd 
want him to make at least a couple of trips over to Tokyo in the interim so 
he can start getting involved even before he moves over there.  But it will 
be important for us to understand what specifically you want Accounting to 
accomplish by the end of May so Heidi and Carol can plan how to support those 
efforts while not infringing on Heidi's responsibilities and demands in 
Sydney.

Meanwhile, I've asked HR to contact Eugenio Perez, Sally's designee for the 
temporary Risk position, to begin those discussions, and Sally said she could 
address transition issues for him next week - she'll be in London 
(Scott/Michael - you should probably give her a call in the London office 
their Monday afternoon).  Perhaps we can get Eugenio over to Tokyo earlier 
than Barry.

Hi Little Mell!!

Vegas is nice.  It has visibly changed since we were last here.  Lots of new
Hotel/Casinos.  The concert was very good.  We came in very late due to
travel delays and missed the first 3/4 of Lenny Kravitz and all of Cheryl
Crow.  My Lagerfeld satchel didn't survive it's gate check ordeal (all the
contents were fine though) so I now have a reasonably nice new bag a'la
Southwest Airlines baggage office.  I'll give you details later.

Last night after the concert, we grabbed a couple of hot dogs and wandered
through some casinos.  While waiting for Steve to go to an ATM I killed some
time by putting a $20 into a nickel slot machine and won 7500 nickels
($375).  Later, while waiting for Steve to use the facilities, I won $40 on
a quarter slots machine.  So far, so good.

Give me a call.  The number here is 702-414-1000.  Ask for Danny Yee's room.

I love you,
Jim

Giuseppe,

Thanks a lot. I would appreciate if you could set up a meeting with Prof. 
Bambos.
We talked to him during our last visit and we would like to follow up with 
some 
specific proposals regarding research projects Enron could sponsor.

Vince

Dr. Kaminski, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and 
me
during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing 
short
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the 
people,
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in
Stanford during the last weekend of February. I will send you an email next
week, so that we can arrange a meeting between you and Prof. Bambos.
All the best wishes,

Thank you for letting me read our Market Overview and Business Model for 
Japan.

When I went to the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference in December, I met 
Masayuki Fujita, who studies the Japanese power market for the Mitsubishi 
Research Institute.  We chatted about deregulation of the industry and about 
the entry of foreign companies into the market.

The Japanese understand the need to deregulate the industry, but want to 
avoid the pain that may be associated with it.  This process is very 
unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the Japanese.  They see power as a matter of 
national security (like agriculture), so foreign entrants into the market 
will have to tread with care, understanding, and sophistication.

Fujita is working on a report for the institute.  He has agreed to let me 
have copies of the non-confidential portions when it is finished.  In the 
interim, he sent me a copy of a presentation that I thought you might find 
interesting.

Regards,



Eugenio

Bill, 
Thank you so much for writing back to me. I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you.  How are things going?  We have so much catching up to do.  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations.  I hope all is going wonderful with you.  Things here are great.  I am almost done with my second year of school (only 2 more weeks)  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last 2 years and I think I passed.  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people.  I'll actually be in Seattle all of August and September, so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug.
How is work?  Are you still doing the same job?  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that.  In fact, that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you.  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle?  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked, but I know nothing about it.  are you living by yourself, in a condo, a home, an apartment?  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about?  I'm sure there is....
Well, I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today, and unfortunately I must go.  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well.  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up.
I have missed you my friend, take care,
Sara

Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.

Thanks, d.n.Message-ID: <28132358.1075855879447.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Carol,

In my research for Enron Japan and trading with Enron Online I spoke with 
Dave Forester.  He explained that the settlements for Enron Japan would be 
handle by Enron North America and would be similar to OTC in Canada.

Would you be able to assist in getting a few questions answered concerning 
the trading?

Who will be handling the Enron Japan Trading settlements?
Will they by settled in USD?  and/or YEN?  What will be the banking 
requirements?
Will the wire transfer request for settlement be processed in Houston?  Where?
What will be the standard settlement terms?


Please advise.

Thank you,
Pam

Michelle:  

ok we are all set up.  We are going to do a snow shoe trip on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. for 2 hours.  Supposedly easy trail, just enough to work up a sweat.  Then we are going to drive (45 minute scenic drive) to Hot Springs, Co.  Probably have time for a lunch.  Our messages are set up for 3:00 p.m. and we get to soak in any one of 21 sulphur pools at our leisure.  Sounds divine doesn't it?

Since they have to put salt on the pavement the guy suggested that we bring our own flip flops.  He says we can rent towels and robes but if I remember I'll bring them for us as backups if they don't have any available.

So looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops.  Oh yeah, do you have a warm pair of boots.  We can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots.  If you don't think you have a pair let me know and I can bring an extra pair along.  Hopefully they won't be too big for your tiny feet.  But boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks!

Let me know,

Vince,

Sounds like there are several Enron people very interested in our
seminar.  Many thanks for passing the idea around.

Do you think that these groups might provide some sponsorship?  I didn't
know whether you have already asked them and they are thinking about it or
whether I need to approach them directly.  I would appreciate any
suggestions you have.

Regards,
Hill

Stinson,

Great! I'm looking forward to a very productive collaboration.
I'll immediately start doing Giuseppe's papers, for him to work
on the Enron/Stanford program.

Many Thanks to you and Vince, and I hope to see you soon at Stanford
or Enron. If I remember correctly, Vince is visiting Stanford in
October.

Best Regards,

Nick

Matt / Ben:

I am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up Unify response and retrieve times.  

Based on my interviews of various desks including AEP and Calgary and our recent discussions, we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month (requirements contracts on wellhead gas).  Following is a recap of what is PROPOSED to be done regarding zero path termination.

1.  All paths that are zero on the last day of a month  (exception noted in #2 below)  will terminate on that day and WILL NO LONGER roll into the following month.
	This path termination out function will run every night.  Any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month's paths UNLESS a volume 
	is on that path in the future month.

2.  Zero Paths marked as "always send nominations" WILL CONTINUE to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option.  It appears that HPL
	(736 paths) and NIGAS (1136 paths) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to.  A special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
	scheduler when you are ready.

3.  Zero paths which roll from month to month using the "Volume Management - Do Not Send" function will CEASE to do so.  This was agree to by Patti in regards to 
	paths for OBA tracking.

ALL:
Please respond via e-mail with any comments.

FYI:  The following is the Unify to Sitara Bridge back schedule from the Sitara Team.  Unify can still send the files to Sitara but Sitara will not process during the "No bridge back" times listed.  This list is in response to several inquiries to me regarding slow bridge-back times to Sitara.    Hours are listed in 24hr  format central time.

Hi Vince!

I got those notes. They should indeed
be useful. The one from Deutsche Bank
is especially helpful!

I am suppose to know this stuff, as I teach it!

Sorry about the delayed billing.
I have had trouble getting a bill
from my excellent asistant, Taichi Hoshino,
who has returned to Goldman Tokyo,
and has not been able to get anything else
done lately. I will try to get something out soon!

We had several energy people,
from several companies, at our credit risk
exec ed course last month. Seems that
credit risk and  power risk go
together these days!

Warm regards, Darrell

Vince,

Unfortunately, the faculty club is closed on Saturday.

>>>Lorrie, could you please make reservations
for 2 at, say, Spieto's.<<<<

I am looking forward to seeing you on Saturday. Shall
we meet at the Terman ground floor lobby at 11:45?
I think the Packard building is locked on Saturday.

Thanks,

Nick

Michelle,

Thank you for your interest in our child care center! We do still have openings in our pre-school class at this time. If you are interested in obtaining an application, you can either pick one up from me at EB1633d or let me send one to you via intercompany mail. Let me know either way.

Regards,

Charla

OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR ENRON KIDS' CENTER IS UNDERWAY!!!

Want to be closer to your child during the workday?  Want to read to them at lunchtime or just give them a hug?  Then consider enrolling your child in the Enron Kids' Center.

Enron Kids' Center child care facility is currently under construction and will be located on Louisiana Street, across from our corporate headquarters in Houston. Enron is partnering with Knowledge Beginnings, one of the leaders in the child care industry, to provide high quality, conveniently located, customer service-oriented childcare for Enron employees in Houston. 


Anticipated opening date:	September 2001

Hours of operation:		The center will be open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM - 6:30 PM. The center will be closed on all Enron holidays. In addition, special "parents' night out" care will be offered for occasions such as holiday shopping and night out at the movies for an additional fee.

Complete meal service:	Your child's breakfast, lunch and two snacks are included in tuition. Infants will need to bring their own food until they are ready for "table food".	

Eligibility:			Regular full-time or part-time Enron employees who are the parents or legal guardians of the child or children named on the application are eligible to enroll their children in the center.  Temporary employees, contract workers and non-custodial parents are not eligible to enroll their children in the child development center.
