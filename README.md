There are two main processes:

### Training
- ```preprocess_samples_supervised.py``` +  ```utils.py``` : raw data input treatment and vectors creation.
- ```train.py```: train a model with a linear kernel and export it.

### Use the trained model
- ```predict.py```: With new data test it and compare.
